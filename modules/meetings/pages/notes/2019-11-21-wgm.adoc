The meeting of the 21st November was focused on the mapping on the CAN in the “Result” stage. OP explained that the mappings are only related to those BTs that only apply to the “Result” stage and therefore were not covered during the mappings on the “Competition” stage. The following table shows the BTs mapped as well as how it is represented in the ePO EA file. All the mappings can be consult in the “Result” diagram:
