**Topic of discussion: Lessons learned when creating ontologies – by Giorgia Lodi**

* Presented to the WG the lessons learned when creating ontologies in Italy. The same presentation was also shared during the SEMIC conference

**Topic of discussion: eOrdering**

The WG continue discussing on eOrdering. The meeting was focused on the email sent by one member of the WG which explained that the CPSV-AP gone through a similar situation to our about the concept situation and that is a class called participation.

This participation class from the CPSV vocabulary was analysed to see how it is related to our situation (Procurement Situation). As a conclusion of the analysis, the WG decided to add this class into our model and reuse the CPSV vocabulary. This class is used for the generalisation of the ProcurementSituation. The WG also added to the UML diagram the class skos:Concept to be coherent to the CPSV and to align the ePO Role to the fact that in the CPSV-AP the roles are skos:Concept(s). The WG also agreed to remove the relation between roles and agent because we are adopting or reusing the CPSV participation class.

Also the WG indicates that we are inheriting Agent and ProcurementSituation from the cpsv:Agent and cpsv:Participation by two reasons/benefits: (1)for the benefits of allignment ontologies (e.g. SDG), (2) doing this alignment we also solve other problems like how agent is being modeled through the reuse of the cpsv agent. The WG indicates that we need to test this asap to see if it works:
