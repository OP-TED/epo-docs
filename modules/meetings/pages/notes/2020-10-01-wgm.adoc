**Topic of discussion: Definitions**

The following concepts were defined during the meeting:

* SelectionCriterionType. Now the type of the criteria is in the class Criterion and the definition for the type is there.
* ThresholdValue. The WG discussed the need to rename this as "Threshold" and to remove the ThresholdValueType. Same actions should be replied in the AwardCriterion class. For this discussion, the WG check within the eForms mappings, how the ThresholdValue was used. The BT-7532 Selection Criteria Second Stage Invite Number Threshold was the concept used for the mapping to the ThresholdValue. The definition of this BT was also took into account by the WG for the creation of a new definition for the concept "Threshold". The WG created a document to understand what is a threshold, based also in the definition of the eForms BT-7532.

Pending tasks related to this work, which will need to be tackled when resuming the work on definitions, are:

* Analysis of the connection between the 'MultistageProcedureTerm' property 'ThresholdValueType' (e.g. max-pass) to the class Criterion
* Similarly to the reflection/decision about the fact that we do not necessarily need a field named 'Threshold' (because it is already solved in the CCCEV in an abstract way), the model 'CAV' being developed by CAMSS/SEMIC could be used to solve the requirement/business need reflected in the current ePO 'MultipleStage' class (e.g. by using cav:Scenario, cav:CriterionEvaluationContext, cav:Score, cccev:Criterion). This topic should be a subject of analysis for the ePO Working Group (to be discussed ASAP).
