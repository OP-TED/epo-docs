**Topic of discussion: Review of the minutes from the 10th and 12th of November**

* The WG requested to have a link in the minutes to the ttl and SPARQL queries used to test reification pattern approach (but the link was already there).
* The 3rd. November's minutes were slightly changed. The paragraph starting with the following sentence was added (just below a UML diagram): "The inclusion of the role and the agent in the generic reification class "ProcurementSituation" makes unnecessary the axioms that we have in versions 2.0.1 and 2.0.2 "epo:Agent epo:playsRole epo:Role and the inverse epo:Role epo:isPlayedBy epo:Agent".

**Topic of discussion: OWL files – OWL script**

The WG discussed two issues related to the script developed by OP to transform the UML into OWL:

* [#issue 261](https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/issues/261)
* [#issue 262](https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/issues/262)

After that, the work on analysis for testing the reification approach(for which use a copy of v2.0.2) was resumed:

* The diagram on Buyer and Organisation was re-discussed and the question of whether this diagram is needed or not was raised, since in the Agent diagram most of the classes related to Organisations are already covered there. The decision was to keep it, since the Agent diagram does not refer to Buyer nor BuyerProfile (and these are relevant from the Buyer perspective).
* The object property “ownedBy” from Channel to Agent was removed. It seemed not necessary.
* The cardinality of the object property "hasRole" between the ProcurementSituation and the Role was modified. Now it is: “*” situation has just “1” role, meaning that one instance of situation involves/affects just 1 Role and, in the opposite sense, one Role may be involved in more than one Procurement Situation
* The relationship between Buyer and Procedure has been also removed, since what is important is getting to the Agent playing the role of Buyer (see figure below). Roles are not connected directly to the Agent anymore (they do indirectly through the Procurement Situations). Therefore, a solution needs to be found to connect the Agent playing the role of Buyer to the Procedure.
