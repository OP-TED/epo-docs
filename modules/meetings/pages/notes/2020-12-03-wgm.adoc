**Topic of discussions: OWL script errors**

The WG used the attendance of a consultant to analyse how to improve/correct the scripts for the transformation of the UML diagrams into OWL files:

* Some errors still persisting were discussed and marked as 'action points':
** duplicity of the same property as DataType and ObjectType;
** class attributes of type 'Code' are pointing to classes representing codelists, when they should be pointing to "_skos:Concepts_";

* Concerning the datatypes listed in the UML2RDF mapping (https://github.com/meaningfy-ws/model2owl/blob/master/config/ePO-default/umlToXsdDataTypes.xml) XSL-T artefact, the WG decided to change the data type marked as "_epo:Text_" (which ended up previously into "_rdf:langString_") into "_rdfs:Literal_". Confirmed that this does not impact on the TED-RDF mappings.

After this discussion, the script will be reviewed and the errors reported fixed by end of the week. Once the errors fixed and a new updated version of the script available, the OWL files will be generated again (this is an action point for everis).

**Topic of discussion: Roles activities**

The WG discussed the activity roles and how they should be modeled into the ePO ontology. For that purpose, the WG analysed the different existing codelists used in the ontology and which includes activities that are performed by roles. For example, the codelist organisation-subrole was analysed and the WG discussed whether the different activities listed in this codelist should be moved into the activity-type codelist which is linked to the reification class. The same discussion took place for the eo-role-type codelist that comes from ESPD.

The WG asks to retrieve the analysis done in previous sessions about the roles and subroles, and to present a proposal in the context of the works done around the reifications reuniting "Agent, Role, Lot, Activities, other".

**ACTION POINTS**:

1. To correct the UML to OWL transformation scripts, due beginning of the next week -> this task was completed on Sunday, the 6th Nov. 2020;
2. To regenerate the TBox of ePO v.2.1.0, due next week (7th to 11th Nov. 2020) -> this task is completed as per today, 10th Nov. 2020.
3. To present a proposal on the inclusion of activities in the reification(s) identified so far, due next week(s) -> this task is not started yet.
