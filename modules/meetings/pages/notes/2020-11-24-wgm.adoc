**Topic of discussion: Review of the minutes from 17th and 19th of November**

* The WG discussed the point on the minutes about the removed property "ownedBy", between Channel and BuyerProfile. The WG said that further discussions are needed and to decide if the "ownedBy" should be kept or not.
* To add the image of the diagram to show the cardinality of the "hasRole" between the ProcurementSituation and the Role.

**Topic of discussion: Channel class**

* The WG discussed whether the channel should be also linked to the ProcurementSituation.
* The WG indicated that if we adopt the reification in a future version, the property "has" between Role and ContactPoint should be removed, because too generic in its semantics.
* The WG discussed whether the class BuyerProfile should be removed or not. The WG indicated that this class has been used in the TED-RDF mappings. The WG saw that the BuyerProfile is used differently in the v2.0.1. The WG discussed which way is the proper one to use the BuyerProfile class. The WG also indicated that using the BuyerProfile we are losing the consistency to the CPSV.
** In v2.0.1 the Buyer is directly connected to the BuyerProfile, whilst in v2.0.2 it is not. The WG decided that v2.0.2 should be connected also be connected to Buyer directly.
** The BuyerProfile is a type of Channel, which is correct and it was not modelled like that in v2.0.1. However, in v2.0.1 this cannot be changed (and will be kept as it is now).
** Will remove the axiom "epo:CentralPurchasingBody epo:has epo:BuyerProfile" in all versions where it is still remaining, starting with v.2.0.1.
