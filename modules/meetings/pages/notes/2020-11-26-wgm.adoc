**Topic of discussion: OWL files**

The meeting was focused on the review of the datatypes used in v2.0.1 and the generation of the OWL files. The need for this discussion came from some errors detected in the OWL files generated automatically with the OP scripts: https://github.com/meaningfy-ws/model2owl

In this sense, the WG worked exclusively on version 2.0.1 of the ontology to see which datatypes are used and which ones are not needed. See the common package ( https://eprocurementontology.github.io/v2.0.1/HTML/index.html).

The WG also reviewed the datatypes listed in the transformation file for the production of the OWL files. See https://github.com/meaningfy-ws/model2owl/blob/master/config/ePO-default/umlToXsdDataTypes.xml the corresponding file. The WG changed the mapping and the UML (we removed unnecessary Datatypes) and produced new OWl core, restriction, and shacl files for the version 2.0.1 UML. These changes will be applied in v2.0.2, as well.
