**Topic of discussion: DCAT-ePO Ontology**

* The Norwegian conveners attended the meeting to present the W3C DCAT ontology and its possible relationship and use in ePO;
* The presentation introduced the explanation of the DCAT;
* The Norwegian conveners introduced their Data Catalogue, the project were they are involved. The project has re-focused (broaden the scope) from records management to "information management";
* The Norwegian conveners indicated their intentions to implement the ePO Ontology in their project for the information management;
* The Norwegian conveners presented an overview and some details of the Norwegian data catalogue. It is composed of 5 parts: dataset, API, concept, information model and public service (BETA);
* The following specifications were introduced and explained during the meeting: DCAT, BRegDCAT-AP, and DCAT-AP-NO v2.0 which is compliant to BRegDCAT;
* An explanation of the concepts of catalogue, dataset, dataset description and data model was done using the IKEA catalogue as an example. According to this explanation, Data Catalogue and Dataset could be represented using DCAT-AP-NO while dataset and datamodel could be represented using the ePO Ontology.
* The discussion entered into more technical details where the WG discussed on how to connect the ePO and DCAT, for example reusing the dcat:Resource class.
* IFLA FRBR/LRM (https://www.ifla.org/publications/node/11412) was also discussed by the WG since W3C DCAT (https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-2/) took some inspiration from it.
* The WG also discussed, together with the Norwegian conveners, about keywords and recommendation and how they could be used. For example, a recommendation from the WG was to take the classes from the ePO and to enrich/introduce the ePO terms in the EUROVOC thesaurus (example of recommendation: say "Tender" to refer to the offer submitted by the Economic Operator, never use "Tender" to mean "Procurement" or "Procedure", and other similar ones).
