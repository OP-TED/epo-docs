**Topic of discussion: SPARQL Queries analysis**

* Possible error detected: superfluous 'P' HTML element in the queries. This is not a real error as it was requested to be added to the text in order to separate the sentences with paragraphs.

* Link: if we have the Procedure ID it should not be a problem to launch a query to map TED data with the National ID for that procedure. Queries will have to be adapted and finetuned to meet Procedure without corresponding ID.

* epo:identifierValue should be epo:hasIdentifierValue

* epo:isResponsiblityOf should be isResponsibilityOf

* How could we detect the possible spelling mistakes in the mapping in order to correct them to run the SPARQL queries. Maybe with SHACL Shapes?

**Action Points**

* Look into ways of treating paragraphs in pdf
* epo:insert verbs infront of attributes instead of using has by default
