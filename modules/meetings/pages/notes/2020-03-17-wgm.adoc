*Topic of discussion:*  Buyer

The WG discussed the issue "topic of discussion" that was created in GitHub and commented. For more details see https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/issues/237.

In this issue was reflected the discussion that took place in the last meeting. According to Jachym’s reply is possible that Buyer has activities in the Public Sector and Private Sector at the same time. Taking into account this response the WG said that if it is needed to know if the buyer has another activity that is not the one specified in the code list main-activity or other main activity the following ideas were proposed:

-	to call the code list “other main activities” as "NACE".

Also, the property linking the Buyer to the code was named “hasEntityActivity”.  Additionally, the WG discussed the need to have two attributes, one for the mainactivity code and the other one for the NACE code. According to the disjointness, this is not possible, we should have just one and then the user selects which code is used. The final decision was to have these two codes and the same predicate with a disjoint to both codes, or the main activity is one or the other one. The attribute in the Buyer class for the codes was named "MainActivityType" code.

Concerning to the attribute in the Buyer class named "OtherActivityDescription", the WG decidedd to rename it “ActivityDescription” and the following note of when this should be used was added in the model:

-	“In the ePO ontology a taxonomy with all activities, based on different classifications (COFOG, UTILITIES, NACE), will be provided. In ePO, this element is to be used exclusively to complement the definition attached to the MainActivityCode.
However, in eForms, there is the code "other" to cover undefined activities. For mapping to this eForms feature, one could also use this property.”

**Action Points: **

-	TR: Provide an example of where a buyer would have difficulty choosing from the codes in the main activity table and where it would be advantageous to use the NACE code.
