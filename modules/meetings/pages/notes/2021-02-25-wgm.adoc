**Topic of discussion: OWL restrictions of the ontology**

The WG discussed about some problems found after running the transformation script (developed under the OP model2owl project (https://github.com/OP-TED/model2owl)) from uml to owl restrictions. Some of the points of discussion were:

* Problems related to the entity owl nothing and how and when it should be fixed. The WG said that it is not a priority for the time being;
* Some inconsistencies have been foun after running a reasoner, but it is needed from where they come in order to fix them. The WG said that the BDTI project may be use for the analysis of this inconsistencies since it is scoped for some few classes of ePO. With this exercise, the WG indicated it will allow to discover wether the modifications need to be done in the uml or in the script.

**Topic of discussion: Cardinalities**

The WG worked on the cardinalities of the attributes of the eProcurement Ontology v2.0.1.
