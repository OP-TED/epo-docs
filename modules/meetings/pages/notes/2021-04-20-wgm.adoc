It was noted that there was some overlap in the presentation “Road towards a European semantic toolchain for public administrations – state of play and future developments” (Thursday, April 22, 2021 9:30 AM to 11:00 AM) and  “Turning UML models into OWL ontologies and SHACL data shapes in the eProcurement ontology project” (Tuesday, April 20, 2021 4:30 PM to 5:30 PM) which is a result of the eProcurement ontology.

The presentation “How to make the most of procurement data” is of particular interest to this working group. (Thursday, April 22, 2021 9:30 AM to 11:00 AM)
