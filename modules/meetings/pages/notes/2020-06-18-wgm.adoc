**Topic of discussion**: Roles and Subroles

The OP explains the need to change the roles and subroles due to the mappings of the current TED forms to the eProcurement Ontology. The OP explains that as the model is now, it is not possible to know which subrole (e.g. recipient, execution of the payment, etc.) is playing a role and its participation in a Lot. For that purpose, Giorgia Lodi explained a couple of examples created to solve the situation. After the explanation of the examples, the WG continued discussing and trying to solve the problem with the usage of examples. The following presentation captures some of the possible solutions to the problem. However, the WG did not arrive at an agreement and everis will propose a solution for the next 25th of June.

It was also suggested to make predicates from the subroles.  The predicate "acts on behalf of" between Buyer and Central Purchasing Body is to be removed.
