**Topic of discussion: Review of the minutes from the 15th and 17th of December**

* Some small modifications were added to the minutes.

**Topic of discussion: Issues in GitHub**

The WG discussed the following issues:

* Issue [274](https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/issues/274)
* Issue [271](https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/issues/271):

** The WG agreed on the following: 1. procedure isSummarisedBy 1 and only 1 CAN only is wrong: The WG decided to change the cardinality 0..*; 2.	hasOptionsPermission cardinality 1 seems irrelevant: The WG decided to change the cardinalities to 0..1.
** Also, the WG agreed that it should be applied in the document that would be provided by the OP, which includes attribute cardinalities.
** The WG agreed that it is for the Application Profiles to decide which cardinalities should be. The ontology has to be as less restrictive as possible.

* Issue [271](https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/issues/271)
* Issue [70](https://github.com/meaningfy-ws/model2owl/issues/70#issuecomment-748187185) from the model2owl repository

**Topic of discussion: OWL restriction files**

The WG indicated that the errors detected were fixed and no errors occurred with the new release.

**Topic of discussion: to check the eOrder diagram**

The WG checked the status of the eOrder diagram. The discussion point were the followings:

* The WG commented that object properties from epo:Lot to epo:Value are misleading.
* The WG suggested to check how the attributes relate to the predicates. In theory, all the predicates would fit with only one attribute.
* An issue will be opened in GitHub to discuss further in-depth.

**Topic of discussion: Usage of modules in the ePO ontology**

* Currently, all the diagrams are translated to a general owl file. In the case of BDTI, they produced a little piece with the data for its specific context.
* The WG discussed to have small ontologies for each of the procurement phases. For example, to have a module for the eOrder with its classes and properties. The common classes could be in another package.
* The WG indicated that using modules would allow reducing the complexity of the Ontology.
* Everis raised the issue of how Enterprise Architect manages the reuse of classes from other packages. It creates a copy of the class, and any change created for classes reused is only applied to the specific UML diagram where it is used.
