**Topics of discussion: eCatalogue diagram**

The WG proposed and agreed on separating eCatalogueReification and create a specific eCatalogue diagram to ease the maintenance.

Action Point: epo:Adress should have fullAddress as a string

The work done during the meeting was carried out taking as reference the diagrams from TC440:

* epo-ecat:eCatalogue definition has been modified. Additional Information removed and used for the definition of epo-ecat:eCatalogueLine

* The epo-ecat:eCatalogueLine was added. The class was defined based on TC 440 and the additional information from epo-ecat:Catalogue.

* A new predicate was added from epo-ecat:eCatalogue epo:isComposedOf epo-ecat:eCatalogueLine. Cardinality 1..*

* A new predicate was added from epo-ecat:eCatalogueLine epo:specifiesItem epo:Item. Cardinality 1

* The class epo:Period was added in the diagram and linked to: epo:Contract and to epo-ecat:eCatalogue

* The class epo:Price was added

* The class epo:Location was added

* Action point for the future: cardinalities should be harmonised – aligned with the 2.0.1 (all attributes from all classes)

* The WG created an issue regarding Predicate harmonisation that concerns isComposedOf amongst other predicates in the Ontology.  Issue 281 (https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/issues/281).

**Topic of discussion: eOrder diagram:**

* Change applied based on previous eCatalogue discussion: predicate from epo:Order epo:isComposedOf epo:OrderLine

* Action Point: Separate the eOrdering and eOrdering Reification under its prefix as it is done in the case of eCatalogue (e.g. epo-eorder:)
