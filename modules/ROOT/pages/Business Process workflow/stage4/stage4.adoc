= Stage 4: Publishing Candidate Semantic Data Specification Version(on the ePO and epo-docs repositories)

In this stage, the reviewed SDS formal artefacts on the Conceptual Model repository are moved to the ePO repository //add link why we have different reps// to become a release candidate and the existing SDS documentation artefacts are moved to the ePO-docs repository where the rest of the SDS documentation artefacts are generated and uploaded on the documentation website of the release candidate. The said website is also generated earlier at this stage. At the end of this stage the Product Owner invites the Wider Public to review the release candidate and decides whether or not to incorporate any feedback received to this release candidate or to a future release.

The detailed business workflow diagram for the Publishing Candidate Semantic Data Specification Version Stage is depicted in the figure below.

The stage can be further be divided into two substages: Part 1 that describes the moving of the SDS artefacts to their respective repository branches and the tagging of those branches for publication, and part 2, that describes the documentation website generation and the review of the release candidate by the Wider Public.



=== Creating the release candidate substage

_Moving the SDS artefacts for Release and generating the rest of the SDS documentation substage Business view diagram_

During the “SDS artefacts transfer” Business Process, the Development Team moves the Semantic Data Specification artefacts from the release branch of the https://github.com/OP-TED/epo-conceptual-model[GitHub OP-TED/epo-conceptual-model repository], to the corresponding release branch of the https://github.com/OP-TED/epo[GitHub OP-TED/epo repository].

In the next Business Process, “Mark the release candidate SDS”, the Development Team creates a GitHub tag in the release branch of the https://github.com/OP-TED/epo[GitHub OP-TED/epo repository], that contains the name of the branch and the “-rc.X” where X is the number of the release candidate for that version. For example, the first release candidate for version 5.0.0 would be placed in the release/5.0.0 branch, tagged as ”5.0.0-rc.1”.

In the “SDS documentation transfer” Business Process, the Development Team moves the existing SDS documentation artefacts from the release branch of the https://github.com/OP-TED/epo-conceptual-model[GitHub OP-TED/epo-conceptual-model repository] to the corresponding release branch of the https://github.com/OP-TED/epo-docs[GitHub OP-TED/epo-docs] repository.

In the subsequent “Produce release notes” business Process, The Development team creates the “Release notes” Business Object by writing a release summary statement followed by the change notes that were automatically generated in the “Generate diffing artefacts” Business Process in the previous stage. See https://docs.ted.europa.eu/EPO/latest/release-notes.html#_release_notes[here] for an example of the release notes.

In the next Business Process, “Mark the release candidate documentation” the Development Team creates a GitHub tag on the release branch of the https://github.com/OP-TED/epo-docs[GitHub OP-TED/epo-docs] repository similar to the one mentioned in “Mark the release candidate SDS” Business Process.

After both “Mark the release candidate SDS” and “Mark the release candidate documentation” Business Processes are concluded, the “Create candidate release” Business Process is triggered. During this process the Product Owner uses the tag on the OP/TEDrelease branch to create a GitHub Release and marks it as a pre-release (as seen on the image below) in the https://github.com/OP-TED/epo[GitHub OP-TED/epo repository], using the release notes provided in the documentation repository.

The Product Owner makes sure that all The GitHub Issues are implemented for this release.

=== Documentation website generation and Wider Public Review substage[[DWGWPR]]

_Documentation website generation and Wider Public Review substage Business view diagram_


In the “Publish staging documentation website” Business Process, the Product Owner generates the static website from the tag in https://github.com/OP-TED/epo-docs[GitHub OP-TED/epo-docs] and publishes it in the staging environment which is not accessible to the public. The Product Owner then reviews the staging documentation website and if changes are required modifies the AsciiDocs pages to integrate the necessary website adjustments. This process repeats until the Product Owner finds no mistake in the documentation website, and the “Publish public documentation website” Business Process can commence.

In the “Publish public documentation website "Business Process, the Product Owner integrates the documentation webpage to the existing eProcurement Ontology web site under the specified version.

In the “Announce the start of the public review period” Business Process, the Product Owner announces the beginning of the two-month review period of the new module by the Wider Public. During this period, The Wider Public reviews the new ePO version in the “Review the release candidate” Business Process. At the same time, in the “Collect, assess and respond to the public review feedback” Business Process, the Product Owner receives the feedback from the Wider Public in the form of electronic mail, GitHub issues and discussions. The feedback issues are then divided into bugs and change requests. In case there are bugs, then the conceptual model needs to be updated for a correct release of this version; otherwise, changes are planned for implementation into the next version. In the former case, the next Business Process will be “ORSD consolidation” (in the 1^st^ stage), and all the stages and processes have to be repeated. In the latter case, the Product Owner can initiate the “Decide to release” Business Process in the last stage of the workflow in order to convert the latest release candidate to a stable release.

== Application and Technology view


The concise diagram for the “Publishing Candidate Semantic Data Specification Version” Stage that describes all the artefacts involved in this stage using business (yellow), application (blue) and technology (green) layers is depicted in the figure below. The GitHub Repository branches that are used for this stage are also depicted as an orange rectangle for reference purposes. Note that here we do not explain purposes of Artefacts, but we describe what is produced and how. The actual description of the produced Artefacts is provided xref:../../SDS and related artefacts/SDSArtefacts.adoc[here].

On the right side of the figure, the “SDS formal artefact” Data Object, described in the previous stage, is moved into the release branch [release/x.y.z] of the https://github.com/OP-TED/ePO[OP-TED/ePO] GitHub Server using a Git client.

On the left side of the figure, the SDS human-readable artefact Data Object s moved into the release branch [release/x.y.z] of the https://github.com/OP-TED/epo-docs[OP-TED/epo-docs] GitHub Server using a Git client.

The SDS human-readable artefact Data Object realises  the SDS documentation Business Object and is composed of the following Data Objects:

* The “Release notes” Data Object realises  the “Release Notes” Business Object and contains the release notes edited by the Development team and the change notes.
* The “Change Notes” Data Object realises  the “Change Notes” Business Object and contains the change notes of the current release that should be automatically created by model2owl, by comparing the current release with the latest release.
* The “Static website with CM diagrams” Data Object realises  the “Conceptual Model visual documentation” Business Object.
* The “Web optimised ORSD document” Data Object realises  the “Ontology Requirements Specification Document (ORSD)” Business Object.
* The “XMI based reference document (web optimised)” Data Object realises the “SDS reference document (glossaries)” Business Object and represents the glossary webpages for each module.

The “eProcurement Ontology staging website” and “eProcurement Ontology website” Data Objects, represent the respective documentation websites. Each website is automatically created by an Antora Publisher Data Object. Specifically, in order to create the staging website, the Product Owner performs the Antora Staging GitHub Action script on the OP-TED/docs-staging Github server. That prompts the antora software to generate the staging website, using the SDS human-readable artefact data Object and the antora metadata files located on the https://github.com/OP-TED/epo-docs[OP-TED/epo-docs] GitHub server as input. The same process is repeated for the generation of the eProcurement Ontology website in the OP-TED.github.io GitHub server.
