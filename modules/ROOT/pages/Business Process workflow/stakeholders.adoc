_Stakeholders business diagram_


As can be seen in the diagram above, there are 4 stakeholders involved in the business process workflow: the Product Owner, the Development Team, the Working Group, and the Wider Public.

*The Product Owner* is the key decision maker and guides the other stakeholders towards project completion. They are responsible for the overall project process. The Product Owner is part of the Working Group and provides the information required to the group for the development of a new ePO module. The product Owner is also responsible for reviewing and accepting the work done by the development team throughout the project.

*The Development Team* is responsible for creating and refining a new ePO module during the initial four stages of the workflow and is also part of the Working Group. The Development Team is expected to  review their work internally before submitting it to the Product Owner for review. While working on the new ePO module, the Development team may also do maintenance tasks related to other ePO modules. These may or may not be part of the release.
(When no new module is in development, there may still be a need for maintenance tasks as well as the development of new use cases.)

*The Working Group (WG)* includes the Product Owner, the Development Team, and other contributors such as domain experts. The Working Group is the primary information provider for the creation of a new release. It actively develops the Ontology Requirements Specification Document (ORSD), and designs the Conceptual Model that implements the specifications listed in the ORSD. The Working Groupâ€™s main responsibility is to make sure that the new ePO module captures all the aspects of the specified domain correctly and as concisely as possible. Other responsibilities include maintenance tasks such as generally discussing ePO GitHub issues, and adding or modifying definitions to existing ePO concepts. 

The Working Group meets twice per week. The first meeting is dedicated to new module development and the second to maintenance tasks. Minutes of the Working Group meetings are kept by the Development Team. After being reviewed by the Product Owner they are subsequently uploaded to the https://docs.ted.europa.eu/epo-wgm/indiv.html[Documentation Site] by the Development Team.

*The Wider Public* includes anyone who is part of the Procurement and Semantic Web Communities that has an interest in the ePO. The Wider Public is invited by the Product Owner to review a release candidate within two months of it being released for review. During this time the Product Owner and the Development Team receive questions, clarifications, and feedback on the new release Candidate. The Wider Public is also invited to at least two wider working group meetings per year so that they can be informed of the latest updates to the Ontology.
