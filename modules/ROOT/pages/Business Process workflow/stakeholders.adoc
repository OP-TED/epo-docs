_Stakeholders business diagram_


As seen in the diagram above, there are 4 stakeholders involved in the business process workflow. These are the Product Owner, the Development Team, the Working Group and the Wider Public.

*The Product Owner* guides the other stakeholders in order to complete the project and is responsible for the overall process of the procedure and makes any important decisions related to the project. The Product Owner is part of the Working Group and as such can provide information required for the development of a new ePO module. The product Owner is also responsible for reviewing the work done by the development team throughout the procedure.

*The Development Team* is responsible for the creation and editing of the new ePO module during the first four stages of the workflow. The team is also part of the Working Group. The Development Team is expected to internally review any work done, before the Product Owner can review this work. While working on the new ePO module, the Development team also does maintenance tasks related to other ePO modules that may or may not be parts of the release.
n the case that there is no new module there may still be a need for the  maintenance tasks mentioned above as well as new use cases.

*The Working Group (WG)* includes the Product Owner, the Development Team, and other entities such as domain experts. The Working Group is the primary information provider for the creation of the new release and actively takes part in the development of the Ontology Requirements Specification Document (ORSD) and the designing of the Conceptual Model that implements the specifications listed in the ORSD. The Working Groupâ€™s main responsibility is to make sure that the new ePO module captures all the aspects of the specified domain correctly, and as concise as possible. Other responsibilities include maintenance tasks such as discussing ePO GitHub issues that may or may not be relevant to the new ePO module and adding or modifying definitions to existing ePO concepts. The Working Group meets twice per week. The first meeting is dedicated to the new module development and the second to maintenance tasks. Meeting Minutes of the Working Group meetings are kept by the Development Team. These Meeting Minutes are then Reviewed by the Product Owner and are subsequently uploaded to the https://docs.ted.europa.eu/epo-wgm/indiv.html[Documentation Site] by the Development Team.

*The Wider Public* includes any member in the Procurement and Semantic Web Communities that may be interested in the ePO. The Wider Public is invited by the Product Owner to review a release candidate in a two-month period. During that time The Product Owner and the Development Team receive questions, clarifications and feedback for the new release Candidate. The Wider Public is also invited to at least two wider working group meetings per year in order to be informed of the latest updates to the Ontology.
