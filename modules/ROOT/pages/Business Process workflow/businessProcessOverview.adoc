= Business process overview

In this section, we describe the ePO Workflow at the highest level of abstraction. The Business Process Overview diagram that describes the higher stages of the ePO workflow is depicted in the diagram below.

_The high-level stages business workflow diagram_


As seen in the diagram, the workflow can be further divided into five discrete stages:

== xref:Business Process workflow/stage1/stage1.adoc[The Requirements gathering stage]

In this stage, all preliminary work is done such as deciding the ePO version that will be released, what contents are foreseen for this release and the creation of the necessary GitHub branches. Also in this stage, the requirements for a new ePO module are collected in the Ontology Requirements Specification Document (ORSD) by the Working Group.

== xref:Business Process workflow/stage2/stage2.adoc[The Designing Conceptual Model stage]

In this stage, the Development Team works with the rest of the Working Group in order to design the Conceptual Model (CM) of the module to be released. The CM is represented as a collection of UML diagrams in a Sparx EnterpriseArchitecture file at the Github CM repository.

== xref:Business Process workflow/stage3/stage3.adoc[Preparing SDS version release stage]

In this stage, the SDS formal artefacts and some of the SDS documentation artefacts are automatically generated in the CM repository by the Model2owl tools using the CM file as input.

== xref:Business Process workflow/stage4/stage4.adoc[Publishing candidate SDS version stage]

In this stage, the SDS formal artefacts are moved to the ePO repository, the existing SDS documentation artefacts are moved to the ePO-docs repository were the rest of the SDS documentation artefacts are generated, including the documentation website of the release candidate. At the end of this stage the Product Owner publishes the release candidate, invites the Wider Public to review the release candidate and decides whether or not to incorporate feedback to this ePO version (resulting to another release candidate) or to incorporate said feedback to a future release.

== xref:Business Process workflow/stage5/stage5.adoc[Publishing stable SDS version stage]

In this stage, The Product Owner decides to publish the latest release candidate of a specific ePO version as a stable release. Consequently, the SDS and SDS documentation of the specific candidate are marked accordingly, and the new ePO stable release is announced.


== The big picture

The whole Workflow including all stages and business processes can be seen in the diagram below. Each row represents one of the stages that a business process is part of, and each column represents a stakeholder responsible for the business processes located within the column.
