This document is a guide to how the eProcurement Ontology can be used.

== Introduction

The ePO Ontology is a structure knowledge model that describes the data used in the EU public procurement process and is a
semantic data specification. The ultimate objective of the ontology is to put forth a
commonly agreed OWL ontology that will conceptualise, formally encode and make available
in an open, structured and machine-readable format data about public procurement, covering
it from end to end, i.e. from notification, through tendering to awarding, ordering,
invoicing and payment. With this goal in mind the OP engaged a Working Group (WG) of
experts with the mission of building consensus on the analysis results and deliverables
developed by the OPâ€™s teams.


Specifically, ePO describes a set of concepts and their relations. ePO concepts can be:
Classes (objects).
Class hierarchies and dependencies.
Roles, attributes, properties, relationships, and actions.



== The ePO conceptual model

=== UML diagrams

In this chapter, we describe the UML diagrams that represent the conceptual model of the Ontology.


==== What is UML

Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a standardized visual language used to describe, specify, design, and document
the structure, relationships, and behaviors within a knowledge domain. Although originally designed to model software,
It can also be used for business modeling as well as Ontology modeling.


==== Classes and Attributes:

Figure 1 below depicts  a Class in the Ontology.
A Class represents a category or a type of entities within a domain. It is a collection of objects that share common
characteristics or properties. A Class can be thought of as blueprint  with specifications that an individual
must cover in order to be a member of that Class. Individuals that uphold these specifications.
are called _Instances_.

Figure 1 specifically represents the Class epo:ReviewRequest. The prefix _epo_ specifies the actual ontology that this
Class was created from. In this particular case, _epo_  signifies that ReviewRequest is a member of the ePO core module.


Underneath the Class, one can see its  _Datatype properties_, commonly referred to as _Attributes_.
Each Attribute Specifies a  constant, which indicates the data type of the value that an object can hold. Each Attribute
also has a prefix, a written definition describing it, (not seen in the picture), and a cardinality. A cardinality
specifies the minimum and maximum number of values that an attribute can have.

For example, Attribute epo:hasNumberOfReviewRequests is a constant of type integer (it can take the value of any integer),
while Attribute:is Withdrawn is of type boolean ()

==== Data types and enumerations:




==== Association, generalisation, and dependency:

Figure 3 depicts association, generalisation and dependency connectors as the only
ones necessary to model the eProcurement conceptual model.
