This document is a guide to how the eProcurement Ontology can be used.

== Introduction

The ePO Ontology is a structure knowledge model that describes the data used in the EU public procurement process and is a
semantic data specification. The ultimate objective of the ontology is to put forth a
commonly agreed OWL ontology that will conceptualise, formally encode and make available
in an open, structured and machine-readable format data about public procurement, covering
it from end to end, i.e. from notification, through tendering to awarding, ordering,
invoicing and payment. With this goal in mind the OP engaged a Working Group (WG) of
experts with the mission of building consensus on the analysis results and deliverables
developed by the OPâ€™s teams.


Specifically, ePO describes a set of concepts and their relations. ePO concepts can be:
Classes (objects).
Class hierarchies and dependencies.
Roles, attributes, properties, relationships, and actions.



== The ePO conceptual model

=== UML diagrams

In this chapter, we describe the UML diagrams that represent the conceptual model of the Ontology.


==== Understanding  UML

Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a standardized visual language used to describe, specify, design, and document
the structure, relationships, and behaviors within a knowledge domain. Although originally designed to model software,
It can also be used for business modeling as well as Ontology modeling.


===== Classes and Attributes:

Figure 1 below depicts  a Class in the Ontology.
A Class represents a category or a type of entities within a domain. It is a collection of objects that share common
characteristics or properties. A Class can be thought of as blueprint  with specifications that an individual
must cover in order to be a member of that Class. Individuals that uphold these specifications.
are called _Instances_.

Figure 1 specifically represents the Class epo:ReviewRequest. The prefix _epo_ specifies the actual ontology that this
Class was created from. In this particular case, _epo_ signifies that ReviewRequest is a member of the ePO core module.


Underneath the Class, one can see its  _Datatype properties_, commonly referred to as _Attributes_.
Each Attribute Specifies a  constant, which indicates the data type of the value that an object can hold (for example a
type of number, a type of text, a representation of time, wether a statement is true or false,etc). Each Attribute
also has a prefix, a definition describing it (not seen in the picture), and a cardinality. A cardinality
specifies the minimum and maximum number of values that an attribute can have.

For example:

* Attribute _epo:hasNumberOfReviewRequests_ is a constant of type integer (it can take the value of any integer number).

* Attribute _epo:isWithdrawn_ is of type boolean (It can only take the values of _truth_ or _false_), and has a cardinality
of [0..1] (this attribute can only have 1 or 0 values).

===== Data types

The datatypes that are currently used in EPO (EPO 4.1.0) are the following:

image::docUpdateImages/UML/figure2.png[]
__ Figure 2: UML visual notation for Datatypes of the Ontology.
__

* The prefix XSD (XML Schema Definition) specifies how to formally describe the elements in an Extensible Markup Language
document (XML). EPO makes use of the data types that are shown in Figure 2.
* Plain Literals represent text and can also include a language tag indicating the language of that specific text.

* URI (short for Uniform Resource Identifier) is a character sequence that identifies a logical or physical resource
that usually connected to the internet. URLs (web addresses) are the most common URIs.

* Decimals are numbers that consist of a whole and a fractional part, while integers represent whole numbers.

* Date is used to represent a certain date, while dateTime is used to represent a certain time point during a day.

* Boolean is used to represent 2 possible values, usually "true" and "false".


===== Associations: Predicates (Object properties), Class generalisations and dependency relationships

There are 3 types of associations between the various concepts of ePO:

* Predicates (or object Properties) drawn in UML as arrows are used to represent relations between 2 classes.
For example, Figure 3 depicts predicate epo:playedBy, that connects classes epo:AgentInRole and foaf:Agent. This specific
predicate should be read as: "AgentInRole playedBy Agent". Also note that The cardinality of epo:playedBy is 1. This means
that each instance of epo:AgentInRole must be played by exactly 1 instance of foaf:Agent.


image::docUpdateImages/UML/figure3.png[]
__ Figure 3: Object Property epo:playedBy
__


* Class generalizations / specializations drawn in UML as arrows with a triangle on top, are similar to the Inheritance
concept of object-oriented programming (OOP). Class generalizations are used to define classes that represent similar
concepts with other existing classes, with the only difference being a number of extra attributes or predicates.
Each class can have many specializations (incoming arrows) but only one generalization (outgoing arrow). For example,
in Figure 4, org:Organization is a specialization of foaf:Agent, and foaf:Agent is a generalization of org:Organization.
org:Organization inherits all attributes and predicates of foaf:Agent (such as dct:title), and on top of that, has a number
of predicates that are unique to that class, such as attribute epo:hasMainActivityDescription.

image::docUpdateImages/UML/figure4.png[]
__ Figure 4: foaf:Agent is the generalisation of org:Organization
__

* Dependency relationships, drawn in UML as dashed lines, are predicates that connect a Class with an enumeration. For
example, in figure 5, vocabulary at-voc:country is connected to Class person:Person by dependencies epo:hasNationality
and epo:hasCountryOfBirth. The distinction between predicates and dependencies exists for 2 reasons:
** Unlike a class, an enumeration cannot exist alone in an Ontology, but requires a connection to a Class.
** Enumerations contain vocabularies that exist outside of the Ontology and are not maintained by EPO.

__ Figure 5: foaf:Agent is the generalisation of org:Organization
__

===== Controlled vocabularies
Controlled Vocabularies, also known as taxonomies, are controlled lists of terms used by the Ontology. All controlled
vocabularies in the Ontology, use the prefix __ at:voc __ .
For example, a Controlled vocabulary could be a list of countries (at:voc:country) or  a set of time periods (at-voc:timeperiod)


===== Conceptual model usage (HTML)

* The conceptual model of the Ontology can be found https://docs.ted.europa.eu/EPO/latest/conceptual.html[here]

* As of EPO version 4.1.0-rc2,  The Conceptual model can be viewed either as an HTML page, or in its original form in an
Enterprise Architect file (*.EA).

* As seen in Figure 6, the conceptual model consists of modules, where each module represents a specific part of the
procurement process.

* In this guide, we are going to focus on the main part of the ontology, __ePO core__ .

==== Examples

===== Query: How many contractors are SMEs for a given country and given date ?

This query aims to count the number of distinct procurement notices that meet specific criteria related to publication
date, country code (Germany), and business size (SME - Small Medium Enterprises).

* Publication date can be found on the Notice Class, and country code and business size can be found on the Organization
class, that is also the winner for that notice.

* First we need to locate the Notice class in epo core conceptual model.

__ Figure q1a: epo:Notice in epo core.
__

* Then we need to locate an attribute or predicate that will give us the publication
date. After some searching, we find the information we seek on the "documents hierarchy" diagram.

image::docUpdateImages/UML/Conceptual model queries/q1b.png[]
__ Figure q1b: Searching for the correct diagram.
__

* As seen in figure q1c, epo:hasPublicationDate is an attribute of Class epo:Document which is a generalization of Class
 epo:Notice.

image::docUpdateImages/UML/Conceptual model queries/q1c.png[]
__ Figure q1c: epo:hasPublicationDate is an attribute of epo:Document
__

* Now we need to find a connection between epo:Notice and epo:Winner. There are many ways to tackle the problem. Here we
are going to find a connection from epo:Notice to epo:Tender through the "procedure and lot relations" diagram (figure q1d),
and then from epo:Tender to epo:Winner through the "award decision outcome relations" diagram (figure q1e).

__ Figure q1d: On the "procedure and lot relations" diagram we can see that there is a connection from epo:Notice to
epo:Tender through epo:Lot
__

image::docUpdateImages/UML/Conceptual model queries/q1e.png[]
__ Figure q1e: On the "award decision outcome relations" diagram  we can see that there is a connection from epo:Tender
to epo:Winner through epo:TenderAwardOutcome __

* As we can see in figure q1f, (role hierarchy diagram) epo:Winner is a specialization of epo:OfferingParty, which in turn
is a specialization of epo:AgentInRole.

__ Figure q1f: Generalization of the epo:Winner role on the "role hierarchy diagram" __


* As seen on figure q1g, epo:AgentInRole is played by an agent of class foaf:Agent, which is a generalization of
org:Organization class which in turn is a generalization of class epo:Business. Here, in order to find the size of
the business, we use the epo:hasBusinessSize dependency to access the at-voc:economic-operator-size codeList.
This list provides the different categories in which the Tenderers to whom a Contract can be awarded are classified,
according to their size (using as Criteria the number of employees).

* Finally, in order to find the country of the Business, we go back to the org:Organization class, and look at the location
diagram (figure q1h). We
