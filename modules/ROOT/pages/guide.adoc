This document is a guide to how the eProcurement Ontology can be used.

== Introduction

The ePO Ontology describes the data used in the EU public procurement process and is a
semantic data specification. The ultimate objective of the ontology is to put forth a
commonly agreed OWL ontology that will conceptualise, formally encode and make available
in an open, structured and machine-readable format data about public procurement, covering
it from end to end, i.e. from notification, through tendering to awarding, ordering,
invoicing and payment. With this goal in mind the OP engaged a Working Group (WG) of
experts with the mission of building consensus on the analysis results and deliverables
developed by the OPâ€™s teams.


Specifically, ePO describes a set of concepts and their relations. ePO concepts can be:
Classes (objects).
Class hierarchies and dependencies.
Roles, attributes, properties, relationships, and actions.
