This is a very generic question, so we need to make it more specific.

Lets translate that question to a query that aims to connect the buyer with the lot and the winner of the tender award
outcome, who was awarded that lot.

Specifically, in order to find this query we need to connect the name of the buyer with the  Lot,
and then find the winner of the tender award outcome.

* First we need to locate the Buyer class in epo core conceptual model (Fig.A1).

__ Figure A1: epo:Buyer in epo core.

* Now we need to find an attribute to identify that buyer. Searching the ontology, we find the role hierarchy diagram (Fig.A2),
  and decide to use the dct:title attribute of class epo:AgentInRole which is a generalization of class epo:AcquiringParty
 which in turn is a generalization of epo:Buyer.

__ Figure A2: epo:Buyer can use the dct:title attribute of epo:AgentInRole as it is connected to it using generalization relations.
__

* Next step, is to find a connection between the buyer to the Lot through the tender award outcome. To do this we use the
award decision outcome relations diagram (A3).

__ Figure A3: Connection from epo:Buyer to epo:Lot using the award decision outcome relations diagram
__

* Now we need to find a connection between epo:Winner and one of the concepts we already visited. As seen in figure A4,
there are 2 connections to epo:Winner from the classes we already visited on the the award decision outcome relations
diagram

__ Figure A4: We can connect to the epo:Winner class from epo:Lot via the epo:Tender and epo:TenderAwardOutcome classes or from
epo:AwardOutcome through the class epo:TenderAwardOutcome.
