=== Introduction

In this Guide, we describe xref:EPO::glossaries.adoc[the Glossaries of ePO]. A glossary is an alphabetical list of terms in a particular domain of knowledge with the definitions for those terms. Specifically, the ePO glossaries contain all the Classes, predicates and Attributes of the Ontology along with their definitions.



=== Glossaries overview

As seen in figure 1, there is one glossary per module for each specific ePO version. Each module is used to describe one specific procurement phase except for the ePO module that contains all the basic concepts that are common to all the other modules.
There is also the link:{attachmentsdir}/html_reports/glossary/ePO_combined_glossary.html[The ePO combined Glossary] that contains the concepts of all the modules combined.

Although all the glossaries are similar in structure, for the purposes of this guide we are going to concentrate on the link:{attachmentsdir}/html_reports/glossary/ePO_combined_glossary.html[combined Glossary]

Each glossary contains three tables:

* Class names and definitions (Figure 2)
* Attributes (datatype properties) names and definitions
 (Figure 3)
* Predicates (object properties) and definitions (Figure 4)

=== Class names and definitions

The first table lists all the Classes in the specific glossary and their definitions. The arrows on the right of the header of each column can be used to short the table alphabetically based on that column. On the right top of the table there is a search field that can be used in order to search for a specific string (character sequence) that is part of a Class or a Definition.

On figure 2, we see the results for the String "certifi", That is the classes
epo-sub:CertificateInformation, epo:Certificate, epo:CertificationLabel, epo:Certifier and epo-acc:ESPDRequest along with their definitions.

Note that epo-acc:ESPDRequest appeared because the String "certifi" appears on its definition. Also note the different prefixes of the classes that denote their respective module. Whereas epo:Certificate, epo:CertificationLabel and epo:Certifier belong to the ePO core module, epo-sub:CertificateInformation belongs to the eSubmission module, and epo-acc:ESPDRequest to the eAccess module.

The definition of each ePO concept is filled in or updated by the ePO Working Group (WG) on the date indicated in the end of the definition. The specific xref:epo-wgm::indiv.adoc[WG meeting minutes] for that meeting can be searched accessed xref:epo-wgm::indiv.adoc[here].

=== Attributes (datatype properties) names and definitions

The second table as seen of figure 3, contains information related to the attributes of the specific module. This includes the attribute name, the class that the attribute is part of, its definition and its cardinality.

In this particular example, since the search field is empty, the table lists all the attributes of the glossary shorted alphabetically per Class name. Specifically, the first elements of the table are the attributes of the Class adms:Identifier taken from the https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-adms/[ADMS vocabulary]. A class used to represent unique identifiers of instances of ePO concepts.

=== Predicates (object properties) and definitions

The third table as seen of figure 3, contains information related to the predicates of the specific module. This includes the predicate name, the definition, and the domain, range and cardinality of the predicate.

By the term domain, we refer to the class that this predicate connects from, and by the term range we refer to the class or vocabulary that this predicate connects from.

for example, in figure 4, predicate epo:hasVariantPermission has the class epo:SubmissionTerm as domain  and the at-voc:permission as range. The cardinality [0..1] dictates that an instance of epo:SubmissionTerm may or may not be connected with the  at-voc:permission vocabulary with the predicate epo:hasVariantPermission, and if it is, there will only be 1 connection at maximum.

Also note that the predicate epo:hasValidityPeriod can be used by a number of classes, such as cccev:Evidence, epo:Technique and epo-cat:Catalogue in order to connect to class epo:Period.
