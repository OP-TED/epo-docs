This query aims to find the procurement notices specific to publication
date, country code (Germany), and business size (SME - Small Medium Enterprises).

* Publication date can be found on the Notice Class, and country code and business size can be found on the Organization
class, that is also the winner for that notice.

* First we need to locate the Notice class in epo core conceptual model.

* Then we need to locate an attribute or predicate that will give us the publication
date. After some searching, we find the information we seek on the "documents hierarchy" diagram.

__ Figure b2: Searching for the correct diagram.
__

* As seen in figure b3, epo:hasPublicationDate is an attribute of Class epo:Document which is a generalization of Class
 epo:Notice.

__ Figure b3: epo:hasPublicationDate is an attribute of epo:Document
__

* Now we need to find a connection between epo:Notice and epo:Winner. There are many ways to tackle the problem. Here we
are going to find a connection from epo:Notice to epo:Tender through the "procedure and lot relations" diagram (figure b4),
and then from epo:Tender to epo:Winner through the "award decision outcome relations" diagram (figure b5).

__ Figure b4: On the "procedure and lot relations" diagram we can see that there is a connection from epo:Notice to
epo:Tender through epo:Lot
__

__ Figure b5: On the "award decision outcome relations" diagram  we can see that there is a connection from epo:Tender
to epo:Winner through epo:TenderAwardOutcome __

* As we can see in figure b6, (role hierarchy diagram) epo:Winner is a specialization of epo:OfferingParty, which in turn
is a specialization of epo:AgentInRole.

__ Figure b6: Generalization of the epo:Winner role on the "role hierarchy diagram" __


* As seen on figure b7, epo:AgentInRole is played by an agent of class foaf:Agent, which is a generalization of
org:Organization class which in turn is a generalization of class epo:Business. Here, in order to find the size of
the business, we use the epo:hasBusinessSize dependency to access the at-voc:economic-operator-size codeList.
This list provides the different categories in which the Tenderers to whom a Contract can be awarded are classified,
according to their size (using as Criteria the number of employees).

* Finally, in order to find the country of the Business, we go back to the org:Organization class, and look at the location
diagram (figure b8). There are 2 ways to access the country: The first is the locn:adminUnitL1 attribute of locn:Address,
and the second is to use the codelist at:voc:country, which is linked to locn:Address through the epo:hasCountryCode
dependency.
