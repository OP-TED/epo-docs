== eEvaluation

In the procurement domain, eEvaluation refers to the evaluation report in digital format created by the evaluation committee/jury (in the case of a designed contest) that evaluates the tenders submitted by tenderers or candidates (in the case of multistage procedures) depending on the procedure that is adopted, to provide input for the award decision. The evaluation report is drawn up and signed by the evaluation committee/jury. Note that the evaluation report is internal, however certain data within the evaluation report may become open to the tenderers/candidates when notifying them on the result of the tenders/qualification submission.   +
During this phase, the evaluation committee/jury may request information or clarification of what is written in the tender/qualification submission, however except for certain procedures such as competitive dialog and negotiated procedures, the information provided may not change the tender in any way.
