= *2 PROJECT DESCRIPTION*

== *2.1 Scope*

=== *2.1.1 Includes ("IN" Scope)*

The project will develop the e-procurement ontology in a collaborative effort among the main stakeholders with the overall objective to overcome the fragmentation that hinders interoperability among e-procurement systems. The result of the work will be a specification showing the conceptual model and its representation in OWL, and the deployment of the ontology and related code lists and classifications on the metadata registry.

The ontology will support the whole of the e-procurement process, from e-notification until and including e-payment as depicted in Figure 1.

=== *2.1.2 Excludes ("OUT" Scope)*

The project described here does not include:

* the practical implementation of systems that implement the ontology, beyond the deployment of the ontology and related code lists and classifications on the metadata registry.
* the implementation of the change management and maintenance of the ontology after its publication (change management and maintenance will however be taken into consideration and described).
* activities to create implementation guidelines; however, future implementations 
will be taken into consideration when developing the ontology.

=== *2.1.3 Scope Statement*

The ultimate objective of the e-procurement ontology is to put forth a commonly agreed OWL ontology that will conceptualise, formally encode and make available in an open, structured and machine-readable format data about public procurement, covering end-to-end procurement, i.e. from notification, through tendering to awarding, ordering, 
invoicing and payment.

The aim of the project is to produce the final ontology within twelve months including a public review of at least two months. Comments received in the public review period will be resolved and integrated in the deliverable, which will then be published.

The development of the e-procurement ontology will take place in an open working group, as recommended in the Report on policy support for e-procurement.

== *2.2 Success Criteria*

* Commitment on the part of the working group members to actively participate in 
the work towards finding common ground with an objective to implement the 
ontology after its publication.
* Consensus in the Working Group on the conceptual model. 
* Expression of the conceptual model as an ontology in OWL.
* Publication of the conceptual model and ontology.

== *2.3 Stakeholder and User Needs*

In Figure 2, the various stakeholders are depicted.

image::{imagesdir}modules\ROOT\images\charter1.png[Figure 2: Stakeholder and User Needs] 

The main stakeholders of the e-procurement ontology are the contracting authorities 
who request the items procured, and the economic operators who deliver the items.
The stakeholders in these two categories provide the data for the elements in the 
ontology, while the other stakeholders use the data provided to meet their specific 
needs.

These needs are related to three categories of use cases:
* Transparency and monitoring: to enable verification that public procurement is 
conducted according to the rules set by the Directives and Regulation.
* Innovation & value added services: to allow the emergence of new applications and 
services on the basis of the availability of procurement data.
* Interconnection of public procurement systems: to support increased 
interoperability across procurement systems.
The ontology needs to be able to satisfy the needs of various stakeholder categories as 
shown in Table 1.

== *2.4 Deliverables*

The following deliverables are foreseen as results of the work.

.Table 2: Deliverables
[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Deliverable Name| Deliverable Description

|e-Procurement Conceptual Model
|Conceptual model of the e-procurement ontology specifying the relevant entities, attributes and relationships. This deliverable will be developed in an incremental way, with several drafts being created and published for discussion in the working group. These drafts will be designed as Working Draft <no>. See also section 4.1.

|Specification of the conceptual model
|The specification will provide the definition of the concepts and relationships and eventual synonyms

|e-Procurement Ontology 
|OWL expression of the ontology. The OWL expression will be included as an annex in D01, but also published separately at a persistent URI under the Commission's URI Policy.
|===

== *2.5 Assumptions*

The following assumptions have been taken into account:
* The e-procurement ontology takes into account the data standards and structures described in the document Data Structures and Standards used at the Publications Office, Version: 1.0.0 of 19 December 2016 so as to ensure seamless testing of the ontology in the environment of the Publications Office.
* The e-procurement ontology is expressed in OWL2 in conformance with the conditions listed in section 2.1 of the W3C Recommendation OWL 2 Web Ontology Language Conformance (Second Edition)
* The e-procurement ontology is made available on-line under the ISA Open Metadata Licence v1.111
* The Working Group consists of experts in the following areas: 
** e-procurement, taking into consideration the perspective of the stakeholder they represent; 
** data modelling and ontology design; and 
** OWL and the wider area of Linked Open Data technologies.
* The members of the Working Group share an objective of reaching consensus by finding common ground across potentially different perspectives.

== *2.6 Risks*

A number of risks can be identified. Table 3 lists these risks with an indication of the impact, the likelihood and a proposed mitigation strategy.
