|https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/issues/3[Contracting Authority class]
|Active 
|The latest version of the conceptual model has the class Buyer with subclasses Contracting Authority, Public Undertaking and Other Contracting Entity (as per Directive 2014/23/EU, art. 7.1). Further discussions will take place on GitHub and during the next phases.

|4 
|https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/issues/4[Is bound to - Relationship]
|Fixed 
|During the third Working Group, it was agreed that the relationship between Contract and Organization should be "is Signed By". There is no need to distinguish "is Contracted By" and "is Contracted To". Further explanations were iven on GitHub.

|5 
|https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/issues/5[CM relationship "responds to"]
|Active

|https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/issues/6[Contracting Authority/extend roles]
|Active 
|The latest version of the conceptual model makes a distinction between the Buyer and the "Procuring Entity", the entity that publishes the Call For Tender. The issue was left open for future discussions in the next phase.

|7 
|https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/issues/7[Call For Tender/Distinction between Framework Agreement and Specific Contract]

|14 
|https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/issues/14[Comments on the "Specifications of the process and methodology" document (in particular use of "relationships" and "properties")]
|Duplicate
|The definitions of classes and properties were updated, ranges and domains are modified where needed.
For now, the definitions from the directives where available were kept, but a GitHub issue was created to discuss the sources of definitions: 
https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/issues/21[]
A GitHub issue was created to discuss whether a relationship is needed between "Contract Award Notice" and "Economic Operator": 
https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/issues/20[]

|15 
https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/issues/15[Use cases] 
|Active 
|The use cases will be further developed in the next phase of the e-procurement ontology.

|19 
|https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/issues/19[Project Charter] 
|Fixed 
|A column was added in the Table 6 of the Project Charter with indicative activities for the different 
working group meetings during the next phase.

|20 
|https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/issues/20[Relationship between Economic Operator and Contract Award Notice]
|Active 
|Resolving this issue will depend on a new issue created about the scope of the e-procurement ontology: 
https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/issues/43

|21 
|https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/issues/21[Defining classes and properties: source]
|Active 
|As agreed during the third working group meeting, as from the next phase, each entity of the model will be discussed in detail by the working group in dedicated meetings. The Directives will be kept as a major source which will need to be respected by the definitions, but, as the definitions can differ from one Directive to another, the supporting parties with the help of the working group will have to generalise the elements and definitions found in the Directives. The working group will have to agree on the preferred formulation of the terms and definitions.

|22 
|https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/issues/22[Providing information for Contract Registries]
|Active 
|The use cases will be further developed in the next phase of the e-procurement ontology.

|23 
|https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/issues/23[Publications of notices as Linked Open Data to enable its exploitation on the Semantic Web]
|Active 
|The use cases will be further developed in the next phase of the e-procurement ontology.

|https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/issues/25[Level of details of the class "Value"]
|Active 
|There will be a detailed discussion during the dedicated meeting in the next phase which will probably be the fourth working group meeting, as described by the table 6 of the Project Charter.

|26 
|https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/issues/26[The related classes of "order" and "delivery note" are missing]
|Active 
|The two new proposed classes need to be discussed by the Working Group in the next phases. It needs to be determined what the definitions of these classes are and how these classes are related to the other classes in the model.

|27 
|https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/issues/27[Groups of "Contracting Authority" should be 
expressed]
|Active 
|This issue will be further discussed in the next phase and the working group will decide whether or not to include a relationship between Call for Tender and Procuring Entity.

|28 
|https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/issues/28[Meaning of the class "Evidence"]
|Active 
|The relevance of Evidence will be commented on the current existing issue and further discussed in the next phases.

|29 
|https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/issues/29[Many types of notices, "Contract Award Notice" is not a standalone class]
|Active

|30 
|https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/issues/30[Difference between "Procurement Criterion" and "Tendering Terms" (UBL)]
|Active 
|There is no direct correspondence between the Procurement Criterion and UBL. The UBL Tendering Terms combine "computable" conditions (e.g. for Quantities, Codes and Indicators) and textual descriptions. Procurement Criterion may also include both types of criteria which will be discussed in the next phases of the e-procurement ontology.

|31 
|https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/issues/31[Insert useful code lists]
|Active 
|The specification should mention CPV as the preferred controlled vocabulary for Classification and NUTS for Country. It will be discussed by the working group which type of code lists the ontology needs to incorporate. 

|32 |https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/issues/32[Agreement on a description of the lasses, 
properties and relationships]
|Active 
|An approach was proposed towards describing the classes, properties and relationships in the ontology. The issue is kept open to be further commented and discussed in the next phases.

|43 
|https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/issues/43[Resource oriented vs. Event orientated Ontology]
|Active 
|In the next phases of the e-procurement ontology development, the working group will have to decide about the exact scope of the ontology. Depending on the decision, the issue https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocur
ementontology/issues/20 would be affected as well.

|44 
|https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/issues/44[Published / unpublished data in the ontology]
|Active

|https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/issues/45[Please provide conceptual data model view]
|Closed 
|The link to the conceptual data model visualisation was resolved.

|46 
|https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/issues/46['Catalogue Request' as generalisation of tendering terms for specific call for tenders]
|Active 
|During the next phases, the working group should decide if the class Catalogue Request will be integrated in the data model. This issue is related to the issue 30 https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/issues/30. 

|47 
|https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/issues/47[Relationships of the class Payment]
|Active 
|A Payment can be made to other parties than Economic Operator. Consequently, the working group will have to decide to which classes the class Payment is related to except for the existing relations with Buyer, Economic Operator, Evidence and Monetary Value. This issue is related to issue 28 for which the latest version of the conceptual data model included a relationship between Evidence and Payment.

|48 
|https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/issues/48[Relationship between use case 'Automated 
matchmaking...' and the WP of LOD2]
|Active 
|The second use case described in this document in section 3.2 about an "automated matchmaking of procured services and products with businesses"has similarities with the LOD 2 work package as identified by Jachym Hercher in the commented version of the specification available in the issue #14 on GitHub. The working group should therefore discuss how this relationship can affect the use case 2 and what should the next steps be.
