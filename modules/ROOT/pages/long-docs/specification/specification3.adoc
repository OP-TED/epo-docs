= *3 EXAMPLE OF 3 USE CASES AND INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS*

The three use cases that form the basis of the initial ontology were selected on the basis of the analysis in the landscaping report. This report defined three categories of application areas for the e-procurement Ontology:

. Transparency and monitoring
. Innovation & value added services
. Interconnection of public procurement systems

The landscaping report contained twelve use cases, six in category 1, four in category 2 and two in category 3. The use cases in the next sections were chosen to cover some of the main functionalities that the ontology needs to support.

The reasons for selecting these three use cases include:
* the use cases taken together cover multiple steps of the procurement process;
* the use cases individually are not too broad, i.e. they do not attempt to cover the whole procurement process;
* the use cases involve various actors; and
* the use cases go beyond the current situation and depict a future target situation that could be enabled, at least partially, by the creation of the ontology.

The other use cases outlined in the report may be included in the further development of the ontology.

s|Element|Description

|Title
|Data journalism

|Category
|Transparency and monitoring

|Description
|Citizens want to have insights in the way that contracting authorities are procuring services, hence spending public money. For example, they want to know who the selected tenderer is, what was the volume and/or the value of the contract, what were the criteria, who is accountable etc. This creates the need, and at the same time opportunities, for data journalists to access public data, in this case about e-procurement processes, interpret and present it in ways that are easy to comprehend by citizens. The e-procurement Ontology will help data journalists, in this context, to access different data sources in a harmonised way, using common semantics, and hence making it easier for them to understand, interpret and combine information, for example about a certain contracting authority publishing tenders in a particular sector.

|Actors
|Media and Journalists

|Final recipients
|Citizens

|Preconditions
|A system or repository which contains information about tenders coming from European sources, such as TED, or national sources, such as red.es, interconnected using the e-procurement ontology. In these portals, public administrations publish mandatory information about calls for tender and contracts between contracting authorities and economic operators. An economic operator was awarded different tenders with different national public administrations.

|Flow
|. Clara, who is employed for the HighWay newspaper in Spain, is calculating the total number of tenders and their volume in terms of EUR regarding public transport in the country. In particular, she is assessing the contract value, net of VAT, for tram maintenance at country level in order to compare it with other countries including Belgium and France. 
. With access to up-to-date and machine-readable information contained on the TED portal, red.es, publicprocurement.be and boamp.fr, Clara notices that the cost for tram maintenance in Spain is much higher than in Belgium and France. She then finds out that the company MyRails requires more money per kilometre to repair the same type of rails used in Belgium and France. The payment evidence adduced proves that, despite the initial agreement, the public administration in Spain is paying more than other countries. 
. Clara publishes the newspaper article highlighting her findings and explaining how she reached those conclusions by cross-referencing data from TED. 
. Thanks to the article, citizens become aware of the spending on tram maintenance between countries.

== *3.2 Use case 2: Automated matchmaking of procured services and products with businesses*

An issue was opened25 concerning the similarities identified between the work package 9 from LOD 226 and this second use case. The working group should discuss how this relationship impacts the second use case and decide about the next steps concerning the use case.

|Automated matchmaking of procured services and products with businesses.

|Category
|Innovation & value added services

|Description
|In the first phase of the e-procurement process, e-Notification, a system provided by contracting authorities or an independent private provider checks the procurement criteria across the capabilities of economic operators. In the case an economic operator fulfils the criteria, the system automatically informs them about the new opportunity. In the case of the criteria is partially fulfilled, the system provides information about complementary economic operators with whom they can cooperate to answer the call for tender. For economic operators, it represents a gain of time to identify relevant call for tenders and potential partners as well as an improved quality thanks to optimised partnerships; whereas, contracting authorities take advantage of increased market competition and of improved quality of tenderers.

|Actors
|Automated system

|Final recipients
|Contracting authorities, Economic operators

|Preconditions
|A system or repository which contains capabilities of economic operators and calls for tender with their procurement criteria published by contracting authorities.

|Flow
|. As part of a regular process, a system finds a call for paperclips. It then maps the capabilities of economic operators available in their own repository, which is aggregating data from European business registries to check if there exist companies that produce the required type of paperclips according to the procurement criteria. 
. From this mapping, the system identifies a partial match with the company BudgetClip and sends a message to Bob, the bid manager at BudgetClip to make him aware of the opportunity and propose him to cooperate with another company, CustomSteel, in order to be able to fulfil all the requirements defined in the selection criteria. 
. In partnership with CustomSteel, Bob prepares the tender and sends it to the contracting authority, waiting for the awarding process to complete and hoping that his tender will be awarded.

== *3.3 Use case 3: Verifying VAT payments on intracommunity service provision*

|Title
|Verifying VAT payments on intracommunity service provision.

|Category
|Interconnection of public procurement systems

|Description
|In the post-award procurement process, interoperable systems between contracting authorities of Member States enable contracting authorities to access information about economic operators across Member States such as profile, invoicing and payment details. In this use case, the Bulgarian Tax Authority wants to verify that the total tax amount27 declared by a company (DigiServices) registered in Bulgaria corresponds to the taxed value of the contract awarded by a contracting authority (EcoEnv) in another Member State (Belgium). In this way, the Bulgarian Tax Authority will be able to determine if the company has paid all applicable VAT.

|Actors
|Tax authority, Economic operators

|Final recipients
|Tax authority

|Preconditions
|A unique way to identify economic operators and contracting authorities, such as BRIS, as well as common classification systems, is required. An economic operator was awarded a tender with a contracting authority.

|Flow
|. The Bulgarian Tax Authority is monitoring the activity of the local economic operator, DigiServices, by reviewing the payments made to them by a contracting authority in Belgium, EcoEnv. 
. In particular, the Bulgarian Tax Authority wants to compare the information about EcoEnv provided by the Belgian Tax Authority including the value of the contract awarded to DigiServices with the information included in the last annual VAT statement that DigiServices has submitted.
. The Belgian Tax authority provides then the information about EcoEnv to the Bulgarian Tax Authority in machine-readable format following the e-procurement ontology specifications. This makes it easy to compare the information against the reporting templates followed by the Bulgarian Tax Authority, as mappings to the e-procurement ontology have been created, allowing the easy data transformation and comparison. 
. The Bulgarian Tax Authority then verifies that the determined amount of the VAT was properly declared and paid in Belgium and therefore there is no need to apply taxation.
