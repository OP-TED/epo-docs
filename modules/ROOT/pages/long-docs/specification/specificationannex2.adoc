Annex II ADDITIONAL ELEMENTS AND DEFINITIONS FROM EXTERNAL 
ONTOLOGIES

Additional concepts such as Order and Delivery Note or Lot were proposed by the 
working group65. In the next phases of the project, the working group will have to 
discuss about the additional elements proposed in order to decide whether those need 
to be included in the ontology or not, and if yes, about the definitions of those elements.

|The Public Procurement Ontology specifies a class contract. An instance of this class is an abstract information entity about a public contract.

|Economic Operator
|The LOTED ontology specifies a class economic operator.

Thus, in the context of European public procurements, we can argue that “Economic operator” is the role played by any natural or legal person that offers in the market some gr:Offering.
