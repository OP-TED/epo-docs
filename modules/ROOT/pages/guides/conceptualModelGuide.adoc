== UML diagrams

In this Guide, we describe the UML diagrams that represent the conceptual model of the Ontology.


=== Understanding  UML

Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a standardized visual language used to describe, specify, design, and document
the structure, relationships, and behaviors within a knowledge domain. Although originally designed to model software,
It can also be used for business modeling as well as Ontology modeling.


=== Classes and Attributes:

Figure 1 below depicts  a Class in the Ontology.
A Class represents a category or a type of entities within a domain. It is a collection of objects that share common
characteristics or properties. A Class can be thought of as blueprint  with specifications that an individual
must cover in order to be a member of that Class. Individuals that uphold these specifications.
are called _Instances_.

Figure 1 specifically represents the Class epo:ReviewRequest. The prefix _epo_ specifies the actual ontology that this
Class was created from. In this particular case, _epo_ signifies that ReviewRequest is a member of the ePO core module.


Underneath the Class, one can see its  _Datatype properties_, commonly referred to as _Attributes_.
Each Attribute Specifies a  constant, which indicates the data type of the value that an object can hold (for example a
type of number, a type of text, a representation of time, wether a statement is true or false,etc). Each Attribute
also has a prefix, a definition describing it (not seen in the picture), and a cardinality. A cardinality
specifies the minimum and maximum number of values that an attribute can have.

For example:

* Attribute _epo:hasNumberOfReviewRequests_ is a constant of type integer (it can take the value of any integer number).

* Attribute _epo:isWithdrawn_ is of type boolean (It can only take the values of _truth_ or _false_), and has a cardinality
of [0..1] (this attribute can only have 1 or 0 values).

==== Data types[[datatypes]]

The datatypes that are currently used in EPO (EPO 4.1.0) are the following:

__ Figure 2: UML visual notation for Datatypes of the Ontology.
__

* The prefix XSD (XML Schema Definition) specifies how to formally describe the elements in an Extensible Markup Language
document (XML). EPO makes use of the data types that are shown in Figure 2.
* Plain Literals represent text and can also include a language tag indicating the language of that specific text.

* URI (short for Uniform Resource Identifier) is a character sequence that identifies a logical or physical resource
that usually connected to the internet. URLs (web addresses) are the most common URIs.

* Decimals are numbers that consist of a whole and a fractional part, while integers represent whole numbers.

* Date is used to represent a certain date, while dateTime is used to represent a certain time point during a day.

* Boolean is used to represent 2 possible values, usually "true" and "false".


=== Associations: Predicates (Object properties), Class generalisations and dependency relationships[[arrows]]

There are 3 types of associations between the various concepts of ePO:

* Predicates (or object Properties) drawn in UML as arrows are used to represent relations between 2 classes. Like attributes, predicates also have cardinalities.
For example, Figure 3 depicts predicate epo:playedBy, that connects classes epo:AgentInRole and foaf:Agent. This specific
predicate should be read as: "AgentInRole playedBy Agent". Also note that The cardinality of epo:playedBy is 1. This means
that each instance of epo:AgentInRole must be played by exactly 1 instance of foaf:Agent.

* Class generalizations / specializations drawn in UML as arrows with a triangle on top, are similar to the Inheritance
concept of object-oriented programming (OOP). Class generalizations are used to define classes that represent similar
concepts with other existing classes, with the only difference being a number of extra attributes or predicates.
Each class can have many specializations (incoming arrows) but only one generalization (outgoing arrow). For example,
in Figure 4, org:Organization is a specialization of foaf:Agent, and foaf:Agent is a generalization of org:Organization.
org:Organization inherits all attributes and predicates of foaf:Agent (such as dct:title), and on top of that, has a number
of predicates that are unique to that class, such as attribute epo:hasMainActivityDescription.

__

* Predicate generalizations / specializations drawn in UML similarly to Class generalizations / specializations, are concepts equivalent  to Class generalizations / specializations, with the difference that they apply to predicates. For example, in Figure 5,  predicate epo:isResponsibilityOfBuyer is a specialization of epo:involvesBuyer. This can be used to represent the idea that a Procedure that is the responsibility of a Buyer should also involve the Buyer in some fashion.

__ Figure 5: epo:isResponsibilityOfBuyer is a specialization of epo:involvesBuyer.

* Dependency relationships, drawn in UML as dashed lines, are predicates that connect a Class with an enumeration. For
example, in figure 6, vocabulary at-voc:country is connected to Class person:Person by dependencies epo:hasNationality
and epo:hasCountryOfBirth. The distinction between predicates and dependencies exists for 2 reasons:
** Unlike a class, an enumeration cannot exist alone in an Ontology, but requires a connection to a Class.
** Enumerations contain vocabularies that exist outside of the Ontology and are not maintained by EPO.

__

==== Controlled vocabularies
Controlled Vocabularies, also known as taxonomies, are controlled lists of terms used by the Ontology. All controlled
vocabularies in the Ontology, use the prefix __ at:voc __ .
For example, a Controlled vocabulary could be a list of countries (at:voc:country) or  a set of time periods (at-voc:timeperiod)


== Conceptual model usage (HTML)

* The conceptual model of the Ontology can be found https://docs.ted.europa.eu/EPO/latest/conceptual.html[here]

* As of EPO version 4.1.0-rc2,  The Conceptual model can be viewed either as an HTML page, or in its original form in an
Enterprise Architect file (*.EA).

* As seen in Figure 7, the conceptual model consists of modules, where each module represents a specific part of the procurement process.

* In this guide, we are going to focus on the main part of the ontology, __ePO core__ .

__ Figure 7: The Conceptual model website. Note the version selector on the top right.

In figure 8, we see the epo core HTML conceptual model menu .

* On the right, there is a collection of diagrams that can provide an
overview of the Ontology, such as the diagrams for the different procurement phases and diagrams about monetary values.

* On the left, the file structure of the conceptual model can be browsed. Specifically the following files and folders exist:

**  epo overview diagram that offers an outline of the ontology.
**  The diagrams folder that contains all diagrams in a hierarchical structure.
** The classes folder that contains a list of all the classes in the module.
** The empirical types folder that contains utility classes that the ontology uses as well as a diagram depicting them.
**  The controlled vocabularies folder containing all the vocabularies used in the module.
**  The datatype folder that contains all datatypes that the ontology uses, also described on the <<Data types>> section of the guide.

=== Diagrams of note in ePO core

==== Μain objects over time and phase oriented diagrams

The Μain objects over time diagram (fig. 9) depicts the most important Classes of each procurement phase and their relations.
The diagrams under the "phase oriented" directory (fig. 10) offer a more detailed view for each phase.

==== Agent hierarchy and agent relations  diagrams

As seen in figure 11, An epo:Agent can either be a person (foaf:Person) an organisation (org:Organization) or a system (epo:system). Classes foaf:Person and org:Organization are themselves generalizations of more specific concepts. The prefixes foaf and org signify that these classes were reused by ePO from other ontologies and taxonomies.
Also, on the left of the diagram we see the directory tree containing the other diagrams of the ontology. Each directory follows more or less the same format. There is one or more key concepts for that directory, agent for example and for each concept there is a hierarchy diagram depicting the hierarchy of the concept, and a relations diagram depicting the concept's relationship with other classes, or vocabularies.

=== Browsing Classes on the conceptual model

All classes of a conceptual model are located under the "classes" directory. Figure 11, depicting class cv:Channel offers an example of what a Class looks like on the model. As seen on the figure, besides the description of the class, there is a number of tabs where each tab provides information on concepts related to that class. For example, the "Attributes" tab lists all attributes of cv:Channel.

A very useful feature of the conceptual model is that each class lists all diagrams that it appears on. To access that list, press "+" next to the "advanced" indicator, under the Class title. For example, we see that on figure 12, there are links for "role relations", "agent relations", and "communication means" diagrams. There is no link for the Order invoicee diagram, as it is part of the eOrdering conceptual model and not the epo core model.
