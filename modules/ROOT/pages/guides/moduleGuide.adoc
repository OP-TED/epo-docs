== Introduction

This guide  offers an overview of the ePO modules including the reasoning behind the division of the Ontology into modules, their purpose, and the contents of each module.

== Modular Approach

In general, the Ontology is compartmentalized into the primary  ePO core module that contains the majority of concepts found in the Ontology, and a number of smaller specialized modules. Each of these modules builds upon the concepts of the core module in order to represent a different part of the e-Procurement process.

As a convention, concepts that belong to a specific module also share a specific prefix. For example, all the concepts that belong to the ePO core module use the prefix  *epo* while all the concepts belonging to the eCatalogue use the prefix *epo-cat*. Please note however that all ePO concepts regardless of module (and prefix) use the same URI namespace:

 http://data.europa.eu/a4g/ontology#

ePO also reuses concepts from other ontologies and vocabularies, using their own prefix. For example, all the ePO modules use the class adms:Identifier (along with specific attributes and properties) from the https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-adms/[Asset Description Metadata Schema (ADMS)] in order to represent the identification of different ePO concepts. Another example is the reuse of a number of concepts from the https://github.com/SEMICeu/CCCEV[Core Criterion and Core Evidence Vocabulary (CCCEV)]





The Modularization of the Ontology per domain/procurement phase offers the following advantages as opposed to just having one Ontology file:

* Accessibility for Business. For example, if someone wants to use the Ontology for querying information on eForms, they should only use the eNotice module. If someone wants to query information about the ESPD request, they should use the eAccess module,etc.


* Maintenance: Splitting the Ontology into Modules  reduces the complexity of the Ontology and consequently, makes the individual modules easier to maintain and manage. https://docs.ted.europa.eu/epo-wgm/notes/2021-01-07-wgm.html[WG meeting 7/1/21], https://docs.ted.europa.eu/epo-wgm/notes/2021-12-14-wgm.html[WG meeting 14/12/21]

* Reusability
** When developing a new ePO module, that module should only reuse the common concepts found on ePO Module, thus facilitating the development process.
** In order for ePO concepts to be reusable by other ontologies, they should be as generalized and uncoupled as possible.

== ePO core

=== Description
ePO core is the main module of ePO ontology containing the fundamental parts of ePO. All the other ePO modules import the core module in order to use its concepts.

=== Conceptual Model
This is the main diagram. To be able to understand the different parts of this diagram and how to read it please refer to the xref:guides/conceptualModelGuide.adoc#arrows[guide to the ePO Conceptual Model]




=== Prefixes and Imports
All concepts that were created for the Ontology use the *epo* prefix.
The concepts imported by other ontologies use the following prefixes:

* adms:
* cccev:
* dcterms:
* foaf:
* org:
* rdf
* rdfs
* skos:
* vann:
* xsd:

== eNotice

=== Description

The eNotice module contains classes related to eNotices and eForms . It is structured in three packages: notice core, eForms standardisation, and standard Forms standardisation. The standardisation of the notices was done taking into account the notice types: planning, competition, direct award prenotification, result, contract modification and completion. This is the so-called “phase organisation of the notices”.
