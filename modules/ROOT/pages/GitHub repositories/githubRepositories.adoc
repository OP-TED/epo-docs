= GitHub repositories

Here, the workflow from the point of view of the three repositories involved in it, is depicted in the form of diagrams, with references to specific stages, Business Processes and comments that explain how the Processes interact with the specific branches. Work is done in parallel in all three repositories, and tags are used, to make sure that all information is trackable. Since all the changes in the Ontology are implemented on the binary EA .qeax files (Conceptual Model), no “bugfix” branches are required. For more information regarding the versioning of the CM EA .qeax file and the reasoning for having three repositories see xref:Business Process workflow/stage2/stage2.adoc#CMVM[here].

The repositories are:

* The https://github.com/OP-TED/epo-conceptual-model[OP-TED/epo-conceptual-model repository] acts as a working repository, that holds the Conceptual Model binary EA .qeax file which is continously updated, and also contains all the files that are generated by model2owl for review purposes.

* The https://github.com/OP-TED/ePO[OP-TED/ePO repository] acts as an official repository that only contains the releases as a set of xref:SDS and related artefacts/SDSmodel2owl.adoc#P1[SDS formal artefacts] and can be released as a distribution package, while the Conceptual Model file remains as a tag in the https://github.com/OP-TED/epo-conceptual-model[OP-TED/epo-conceptual-model repository].

* The https://github.com/OP-TED/epo-docs[OP-TED/epo-docs] acts as an official repository that only contains the releases as a set of xref:SDS and related artefacts/SDSmodel2owl.adoc#P2[SDS documentation artefacts], and is used as a source for the https://docs.ted.europa.eu/epo-home/index.html[ePO documentation website].

=== Diagram legend:[[LEG]]
** _Vertical black lines_ indicate that a branch is not part of the workflow.
** _Vertical grey lines_ indicate that a branch is part of the workflow, but no commit actions have been performed for it yet.
** _Vertical blue arrows_ indicate that a specific Branch is part of the workflow.
** _Horisontal blue arrows_ indicate a merge GitHub action from one branch to another.
** _Horisontal _dotted blue arrows_ indicate:
*** If the arrow connects two branches: The arrow signifies that a commit done in the branch of the repository that the arrow starts from has to be redone in the branch that the arrow points.
*** If the arrow is connected only to one branch: The arrow signifies that a number of Artefacts is moved to/from the branch in the repository from/to a branch in another repository via a commit action.
** _Black dots_ signify a commit action on the repository.
** _Horisontal black hyphen arrows_: Indicate that a Business Process represents a specific commit action.
** _Red arrows_ Indicate that a comment refers to a specific commit action.
** _Horisontal Red hyphen lines_ indicate the Wider Public review taking place.
