== *The Ontology Methodology Explained*

The initial stage of the project covered the following tasks:

* The creation of a project plan, specifying the different actors, their roles, and what input was required from them.
* Identifying examples for each step of the eProcurement process.
* Identifying and documenting three use cases to assist with the creation of the ontology. 
* Defining the different phases needed to create the ontology, and the intermediary processes within these phases, giving examples taken from the three use cases.
* Setting up a working group composed of stakeholders from multiple interested groups (WGS or wider working group) . This working group decides by consensus how the ontology should be developed at all stages.

=== *Methodology*
==== *Competency Questions*
The Working Group and the Publications Office worked together to draft competency questions which were then used to create SPARQL (database) queries for testing.
The methodology was used as illustrated below to develop competency questions:

Use cases are then developed to create user stories. 
User stories are a method of helping identify information requirements. The method consists in drafting very simple sentences structured around three main questions:

*  Who is the beneficiary of an action? <role of the user>
*  What is the need? <something> 
*  What is the benefit? <the benefit>

The structure of the sentence is always as follows:

 *“As a <role of user>, I need <something> in order to gain <the benefit>.”*

.Example
As a contracting authority <role of the user> I need to know the number of tenderers that have submitted a tender <something> so that I can add it to the award notice <the benefit>.
