== *eInvoicing*   +
In the procurement domain, eInvoicing (electronic invoicing) refers to the digital exchange of invoice documents between a Buyer and a Seller. Unlike traditional paper invoices, eInvoices are generated, transmitted, and received in a structured digital format (typically using XML), thus enabling faster and more accurate processing, reducing errors and enhancing compliance with tax regulations.   +
eInvoicing improves efficiency, enables real-time tracking, and supports better financial management by streamlining the entire invoicing workflow.  In the context of eProcurement Ontology (ePO), eInvoicing plays a crucial role in understanding the actual public spending. Modelling the concepts from the eInvoicing in the eProcurement Ontology will enable the creation of data sets containing invoicing information. Such data sets are foreseen in solutions like the https://single-market-economy.ec.europa.eu/single-market/public-procurement/digital-procurement/public-procurement-data-space-ppds_en[Public Procurement Data Space] (PPDS).
