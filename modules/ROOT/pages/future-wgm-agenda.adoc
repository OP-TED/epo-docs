== Future Working Group Meeting agenda

=== Agenda

* Show WG how the Diagrams Values are currently transposed from the sandbox into the ePO model:
** Show the Information classes
** Show the AwardResult situation
* In eForms  (Rethink Tender/TenderLot, Tender as something englobing a group of lots):
** Tender is perLot or group of lot, which is not necessarily the same as a LotGroup;
** A contract is per Tender
* Show proposed Review model.
* We can look into Roles.
* Situations shall still be revised first.
