To propose a new relationship or to create any issue related to relationships, please link:https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/labels/CM%20-%20Relationships[**click here**] and then click on "New issue". In the first case, **adapt** the first column of the table proposed to follow the property template below:

|Element|Description|
|---|---|
|Label|A short title of the property, e.g. “hasVAT”|
|Definition|A definition of the concept that is accepted by the working group members within the context of the e-procurement ontology.|
|Domain|A domain is a way to state that any resource that has a given property is an instance of one or more classes. E.g. the relationship “publishes” has domain “Contracting Authority” and range “call for tender”.|
|Range|A range state that the values of a property are instances of one or more classes, e.g. the relationship “publishes” has domain “Contracting Authority” and range “call for tender”.|
|Cardinality|The cardinality is way to define the relationship between two entities in a data model, e.g. one-to-one (1..1), one-to-many (1..n), etc.|  

Use the second column of the template as **guidance** to propose the new relationship.
