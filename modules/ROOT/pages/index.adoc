[underline]#What it is:#
The eProcurement Ontology (ePO) is a semantic ontology related to EU public procurement.

[underline]#What it does:#
ePO is a tool that conceptualizes, formally encodes and provides structured data about public procurement in both human and machine-readable formats according to EU regulations and directives.

[underline]#Scope:#
ePO covers public Procurement from end to end, i.e. from notification, to tendering to awarding, ordering, invoicing and payment.

[underline]#How:#
In order to build and maintain the ontology, OP engaged a Working Group (WG) of experts with the mission of building consensus on the analysis results and deliverables developed by the OPâ€™s teams.
