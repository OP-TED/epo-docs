== Discussion

* The following points related to eInvoicing were discussed:
** The Structure of eInvoicing can be quite complex :
*** For example, an invoice may create other invoices.
** The core of the eInvoicing module should be  an invoice from an Awarded contract.
** It was discussed that there  should be a clear eInvoicing process on the module.
** Most important concept in the invoice: VAT.
** PEPOL model should be referenced as a resource, but material taken from it  should not be used.
*  EPO concept definitions:

** Epo:VechicleInformation definition was updated:
*** "Information related to clean vehicles legislation.
** Additional information:
In the European Union, the legislation concerned is the European Parliament and Council 2009/33/EC (Clean Vehicles Directive – CVD).
