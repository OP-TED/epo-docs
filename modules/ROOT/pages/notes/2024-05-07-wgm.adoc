== Agenda

* eInvoicing
* Evolution of the ePO modules
* eFulfilment data model.

== Discussion


=== eInvoicing
* The following points related to eInvoicing were discussed:
** The Structure of eInvoicing can be quite complex :
*** For example, an invoice may create other invoices.
** The core of the eInvoicing module should be  an invoice from an Awarded contract.
** It was discussed that there  should be a clear eInvoicing process on the module.
** Most important concept in the invoice: VAT.
** PEPOL model should be referenced as a resource, but material taken from it  should not be used.

* It was decided that the eInvoicing user stories will be collected and discussed/validated in the WG meeting of 16/05/2024.
This decision was taken due to the fact that tuesday WG meetings became meetings about other ePO modules and maintenance and the thursdays WG meetings will be about eInvocing development starting from 16/05/2024

===  Evolution of the ePO modules


** Epo:VechicleInformation definition was updated:
*** "Information related to clean vehicles legislation.
** Additional information:
In the European Union, the legislation concerned is the European Parliament and Council 2009/33/EC (Clean Vehicles Directive – CVD).
WG approval 07/05/2024"

=== eFulfilment data model.


* The alignment between PEPPOL business term requirements and ePO eFulfilment continued from where it left off in the last working group meeting on the eFulfilment module (see https://docs.ted.europa.eu/epo-wgm/notes/2024-03-07-wgm.html[WG meeting]). During the meeting the following concepts were covered from the Dispatch advice data model:
** Transport means
*** Air Transport
*** Road Transport
*** Rail Transport
*** Maritime Transport
*** Measurement Dimension
*** Fuel Consumption
*  It was also noted that there may be more than one vehicleSegment on road transports.

== Action Points


* Create a ticket: change the name of epo:VehicleInformation in ePO 5.0.0
* Collect requirements of eInvoicing and present them on 16/5/2024.
