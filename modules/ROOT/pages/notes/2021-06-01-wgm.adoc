**Topic of discussion: Class epo:Value**

The following diagram was presented for discussion:

It seems weird that the contract has no value.

We should consider 'hasEstimatedValue' = 1

The predicate 'hasAwardedEstimatedValue' has cardinality '0..1', which is replaced with '1'.

In this predicate 'hasAwarded' means the award decision has been taken.

In the Italian model each lot can have more than one award decision with different contractors and different awarded value.

Giorgia will check the use of property chains in OWL to be defined in case of ego for the properties Lot isAwardedTo Tender, Tender hasFinanacialOfferValue, Value and Lot hasAwardedValue Value.

Cardinalities are not in scope in this case. But Giorgia will check them as well.

We could also replace ‘Value’ with ‘MonetaryValue’. This will have consequences in the whole model. For example: hasAwardedValue should be replaced with hasAwardedMonetaryValue. We have to be careful and check if Amount is used in other places.

**Topic of discussion: Class epo:Amount**

epo:OverallAmount could be replaced with ‘TotalAmount’ but we need to check the history of this name in the next meeting.

Issue: the attributes have no definition.

This discussion will continue on Thursday 03 June 2021
