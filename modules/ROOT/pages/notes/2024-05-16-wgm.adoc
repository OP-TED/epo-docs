* eInvoicing

== Discussion

* A draft of the eInvoicing ORSD document was presented and edited by the Working Group.
** The concepts of roles that participate in eInvoicing were discussed:
*** Buyer
*** Seller
*** Payee (if it is different than the Seller)
*** Seller Tax representative
** Specifically, it was mentioned that the eInvoicing model does not explicitly show who is the service provider or/nor any checks made on who the service provider is.
*** It was also noted that the Invoice should be linked to the Buyer.
** The Activity description part of the draft was discussed. The following statements were compiled:
*** The Seller generates an invoice and the additional supporting documents.
*** The Seller sends the invoice to the Buyer.
*** The Buyer receives and processes the invoice.
*** The Buyer pays the Seller/Payee the amount of the invoice before the due date.
*** It was decided that the scope of the module will not include penalties, fraudulent charges, and unpaid invoices after their due date at this stage of the module.
** The user stories part of the ORSD was presented and discussed.
