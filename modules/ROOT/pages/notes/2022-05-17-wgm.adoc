=== Agenda

* Collect feedback on the refactored model

* Presenting the document from CPSV: comparison between the CPSV-AP approach and the ePO approach.
** A Concession Contract is a new specific type of Contract.
** Adding this as a new class in the ePO model, epo:ConcessionContract.
** The definition can be taken from the Directive 2014/23/EU
==== Overview diagrams for the ePO model

* Overview

* Monetary values
* Aspect views for:
** Procurement objects

** Criterion
** Terms
** Agents
** Location
** Roles
** Documents
** Contextual information
** Notice description
** Data types
* The Glossary is under development and will be available in the HTML format.
* Planning to publish 3.0.0 beta by July 2022
* Revise, collect and implement the feedback
* Publish 3.0.0 by mid-July 2022
* We might not have all the definitions in place yet.
* Proposing to put all epo classes in a flat list when publishing the model.
* The Lot is not subject to the Contract Term; it foresees the Contract Term.
* Contract terms are foreseen in the Lot and in the Contract they are used.

=== Decisions

==== On extending the core vocabularies

* If we are sure that the concepts in the Core Vocab cover everything that we have in the ePO model we can use it directly.
* If we need additional things typical to the domain we should extend the model.

=== Action points
