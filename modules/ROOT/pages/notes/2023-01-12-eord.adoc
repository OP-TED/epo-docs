=== Discussion

==== eContract

* General contract condition data model  (standard model)
* Specific contract conditions data model
** names, parties
* Why not limit to simply what is specified in eForms rather than a fully fledged contract model.
** Because the main purpose is to cover the needs of eForms.
*  proposal to align with OCD
** https://www.open-contracting.org/data-standard/#why[https://www.open-contracting.org/data-standard/#why]
* We will not talk about Contract Performance till March 2023, but mainly what is necessary to represent Contract Modifications covered by the eForms
** General conditions
** Specific conditions
** Contractor
** …
* Procurement with the Contract in the Center is a valid frame of reference / modelling perspective.
* What about the Contract Performance data?
** It is hard to standardise. Only generic properties and concepts can be modelled.
** For example think of Service Level Agreement (SLA), which is an attachment to a contract.
** We don’t want standardise service level agreement
==== eOdering order only

*  The response is part of the order model and shall be included in order to support the data exchange processes and choreography.
* So Order Only and Ordering (with Response) are artificial separations in PEPPOL like diagrams in EPO provide views on the same (whole) model.
* Order response : information what is the response
* Order and order response are almost the same
* Create an issue in github about data models
** https://github.com/OP-TED/ePO/issues[https://github.com/OP-TED/ePO/issues]

* We should develop the core but developing modulus is not  a major release.
* Are there still some concepts that can be related to both order or order line?.

==== eOrdering and response

* Resource: https://docs.peppol.eu/poacc/upgrade-3/profiles/28-ordering/[https://docs.peppol.eu/poacc/upgrade-3/profiles/28-ordering/]
* Update the eOrdering old version

==== Revise eFulfillment

==== Despatch advice concepts


* All information is in line level
* Shipment is a company to delivery
* eCMR  and Dispatch advice should have relation
* eCMR should link to order
* eCMR might refer to the dispatch advice (as a barcode and URI) as the DESADV might refer to the eCMR.
* Shipment during the delivery or despatch of the goods is accompanied by an eCMR document as it had been ratified by the majorities of the MS.
* Consignment consists of TransportHandlingUint (THU)
* THU is not the Package, but it is also the Package
** THU is the container
** Package is the Pallet or the box
* OP does not need to take everything on despatch from PEPPOL.
* To be modelled
** http://bis.beast.se/peppol-logistics/main/syntax/AdvancedDespatchAdvice/tree/[http://bis.beast.se/peppol-logistics/main/syntax/AdvancedDespatchAdvice/tree/]
** 2 diagrams are still to be received from the meeting depicting “that”
** Advanced despatch is based on UBL 3.1 and aims at including the simpel despatch.
** The main differences:
*** Uses of transport event (seems similar to SHipmentInformation within EPO)
*** Consignment uses are more narrow
** It is okay to have differences

==== Feedback

==== Bullet points extracted from an Email  on 02/11/2022

* Item Property. Add “ValueQualifier”, Standardized and predefined classification of *items properties*
* Shipment. Addition in TransportHandlingUnit
** “Handling unit type”, The type of packaging that represents the handling unit, such as box, pallet, container etc.
** “Handling unit shipping marks”, Free-form description of the marks and numbers on a transport unit or package.
** “Measurement dimensions”, (?)
*** “Attribute identifier”, Code to indicate if the measure is gross weight or gross volume. And maybe length, height, width (?)
*** “Measure”, incl unitcode
* “Package” within this handling unit
** “Package identifier”
** “Packaging type code”, The type of packaging used, such as box, pallet, container etc.


=== Action point:

* Update html version of eOrdering (ordering and response) and send for revision.
* Model the Advanced despatch from PEPPOL[http://bis.beast.se/peppol-logistics/main/syntax/AdvancedDespatchAdvice/tree/[here]] + using diagrams from the meeting for guidance
* Harmonise across modules (order/catalogue/despatch and their lines + the information hubs that may associate with some or all of them)
