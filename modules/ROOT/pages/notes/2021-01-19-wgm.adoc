* The WG also discussed about the BuyerProfile and if it should be linked to the Agent class. The answer is yes, but in v2.0.1 and v.2.02 it is modelled differently due to no reifications are used in previous versions.

**Topic of discussion: Abstract classes**

* Discussion about the meaning of abstract classes. In UML an abstract class is never implemented.

For instance, it is not possible to implement an individual of the class notice since it is a document itself, same happens with technique, but you can implement the types of notices "Contract Notice" "Contract Award Notices", etc.
