== Working Group meeting 10/12/2019

Participants: Paloma Arillo Aranda, Ana-Maria Babaligea, Thor Møller, Natalie Muric, Juan Carlos Segura and Enric Staromiejski.

The meeting of the 10th December was focused on the mapping of the CAN in the “Result” stage. Natalie Muric explained that this morning Juan Carlos, Thor, Giorgia and herself were working on all the BTs with data type value in order to see how they should be mapped. Natalie showed and explained the mappings came up from that analysis session. Natalie remarked as the main output of this session the fact that we created sub-properties of properties. The properties created are sub-properties of the properties Document “relates To” Procedure. These sub-properties are different in each phase:

* In the case of a Planning form, this sub-property notifies is used.

* In the case of Competition form, this sub-property announces is used.

* In the case of Result form, this sub-property summarises is used.

The following table shows the BTs mapped as well as how it is represented in the ePO EA file. All the mappings can be consulted in the “Result” diagram:

Other comments:

* The WG decided to remove the property “hasCeilValue” that linked Procedure and Procurement Value because it is not used anymore in eForms.
