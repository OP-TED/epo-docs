== Working Group meeting

*Date:* 10/05/2022  +
*Participants:* Cecile Guasch, Natalie Muric, Giovanni Paolo Sellitto +
*Model editor:* Eugeniu Costetchi +
*Note editor:* Andreea Pasăre

=== Agenda

* Collect feedback on the refactored model
=== Discussion


* The upper level of the chain can not be accessed and there might have been relationships at the upper level (how the Tender is involved in the submission process).
* Creating a Glossary for procuring it at the european level.
* Takes time to familiarise with the model

==== Publication: asserts inventory

* EAP model
* OWL core, OWL restrictions, SHACL shapes,
* HTML generated by EA with diagrams
* Glossary of terms (classes, properties, attributes)
* Documentation explaining where the assets are and how to navigate them
==== Publication plan:

* Revise in the WG narrower
** Collect feedback
** Implement or plan for the future
* Revise in the WG broader
** Collect feedback
** Implement or plan for the future
* Publish
==== Feedback

* Need Tenderer and Submission view
* DOLCE in Core vocabularies might be inconsistent
* The objects over time view is valuable
==== User experience

* Main objects over time
* Unfold phases
* Unpack what is relevant for each phase ( which objects/types? )
=== Action points

* Prepare and publish a glossary of classes and properties/attributes
** An HTML page sorted with an index (A, B, C)
* Find a way to make the model easily presentable
** Creating easily to navigate diagrams
* Contextual information hierarchies/relation diagrams needs reworking
** Dangling objects?
** What keeps them together?
** Award
* Add connections between roles and objects
** Tenderer tender
** Lot/Procedure buyer
* Make sure that the roles have the context clearly indicated
** Which objects may be valid contexts for each role
* Make a diagram for
** Submission
** Award
** Contract
* Finally put all the classes in a flat list
* Hide links to objects that are not part of the core
** E.g. upper level
** E.g. diagrams from other modules
* Model the Award Decision
** An AwardDecision can capture outcomes of awarding multiple Lots
*** Rename the LotAwardOutcome into “LotAwardDecision”
** The AwardDecision is not a document it is a ProcurementObject
** A Procedure can have multiple AwardDecisions
** An AwardDecision has identifier
** A Tender and an AwardDecisions are at the same level
* Show how terms are associated to a Procedure, Lot, Contract
* Presenting the FIBO model with agent-in-role pattern.
* epo:Contract - epo:LotAwardDecision: rename the relation from _epo:includesLotAwardOutcome_ into _epo:isResultOfLotAwardDecision_
* epo:ContractTerm should be connected to the epo:Contract and not the epo:Lot (?)
** Shall we consider the epo:TemplateContract / epo:DraftContract
