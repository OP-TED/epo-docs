== CONSIDERATIONS ON THE BUSINESS CASE

Public procurement represents around 20% of GDP in Europe. This big buying volume offers a high economic potential to enhance efficiency of European procurement. The EU is investing significantly on the digitalisation of the public procurement process (referred to as e-procurement). This goes beyond simply moving to electronic tools; it rethinks various pre-award and post-award phases with the aim to make them simpler for businesses to participate in and for the public sector to manage. It also allows for the integration of data-based approaches at various stages of the procurement process.

Directive 2014/24/EU on public procurement, Directive 2014/25/EU on procurement by entities operating in the water, energy, transport and postal services sectors, and Directive 2014/23/EU on the award of concession contracts establish rules on the procedures for procurement by contracting authorities with respect to public contracts, design contests and concessions, requiring contracting authorities in the EU to publish notices above certain thresholds. Directive 2014/55/EU on electronic invoicing in public procurement5 defines the requirement for a European standard for electronic invoices, while the Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/19866 specifies standard forms for the publication of notices in the Official Journal of the European Union.Article 6 of the Regulation states that either the eNotices online application or the TED eSender systems should be used to electronically transmit notices to the Publications Office of the European Union. From a different angle, the implementation of the revised PSI directive7 across the EU is calling for open, unobstructed access to public data in order to improve transparency and to boost innovation via the reuse of public data. 

Procurement data has been identified as data with a high-reuse potential. Therefore, making this data available in machine-readable formats, following the data as a service paradigm, is required in order to maximise its reuse. 
Given the increasing importance of data standards for e-procurement, a number of initiatives driven by the public sector, the industry and academia have been kick started in the recent years. Some have grown organically, while others are the result of standardisation work. The vocabularies and the semantics that they are introducing, the 
phases of public procurement that they are covering, and the technologies that they are using all differ. These differences hamper data interoperability and thus its reuse by them or by the wider public. This creates the need for a common data standard for publishing public procurement data, hence allowing data from different sources to be 
easily accessed and linked, and consequently reused. 

In this context, the Publications Office of the EU aims to develop an e-procurement ontology. The objective of the e-procurement ontology is to act as this common standard on the conceptual level, based on consensus of the main stakeholders and designed to encompass the major requirements of the e-procurement process in conformance with the Directives and Regulation mentioned above.

== PROJECT DESCRIPTION

=== Scope

==== Includes ("IN" Scope)
The project will develop the e-procurement ontology in a collaborative effort among the main stakeholders with the overall objective to overcome the fragmentation that hinders interoperability among e-procurement systems. The result of the work will be a specification showing the conceptual model and its representation in OWL, and the deployment of the ontology and related code lists and classifications on the metadata registry.

The ontology will support the whole of the e-procurement process, from e-notification until and including e-payment as depicted in Figure 1.

image::charter1.png[Figure 1: e-procurement phases]

==== Excludes ("OUT" Scope)

The project described here does not include:

* the practical implementation of systems that implement the ontology, beyond the deployment of the ontology and related code lists and classifications on the metadata registry.
* the implementation of the change management and maintenance of the ontology after its publication (change management and maintenance will however be taken into consideration and described).
* activities to create implementation guidelines; however, future implementations
will be taken into consideration when developing the ontology.

==== Scope Statement

The ultimate objective of the e-procurement ontology is to put forth a commonly agreed OWL ontology that will conceptualise, formally encode and make available in an open, structured and machine-readable format data about public procurement, covering end-to-end procurement, i.e. from notification, through tendering to awarding, ordering,
invoicing and payment.

The aim of the project is to produce the final ontology within twelve months including a public review of at least two months. Comments received in the public review period will be resolved and integrated in the deliverable, which will then be published.

The development of the e-procurement ontology will take place in an open working group, as recommended in the Report on policy support for e-procurement.

=== Success Criteria

* Commitment on the part of the working group members to actively participate in
the work towards finding common ground with an objective to implement the
ontology after its publication.
* Consensus in the Working Group on the conceptual model.
* Expression of the conceptual model as an ontology in OWL.
* Publication of the conceptual model and ontology.

=== Stakeholder and User Needs

In Figure 2, the various stakeholders are depicted.

image::charter2.png[Figure 2: Stakeholder and User Needs]

The main stakeholders of the e-procurement ontology are the contracting authorities
who request the items procured, and the economic operators who deliver the items.
The stakeholders in these two categories provide the data for the elements in the
ontology, while the other stakeholders use the data provided to meet their specific
needs.

These needs are related to three categories of use cases:

* Transparency and monitoring: to enable verification that public procurement is
conducted according to the rules set by the Directives and Regulation.
* Innovation & value added services: to allow the emergence of new applications and
services on the basis of the availability of procurement data.
* Interconnection of public procurement systems: to support increased
interoperability across procurement systems.
The ontology needs to be able to satisfy the needs of various stakeholder categories as
shown in Table 1.

=== Deliverables

The following deliverables are foreseen as results of the work.

.: Deliverables
[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Deliverable Name| Deliverable Description

|e-Procurement Conceptual Model
|Conceptual model of the e-procurement ontology specifying the relevant entities, attributes and relationships. This deliverable will be developed in an incremental way, with several drafts being created and published for discussion in the working group. These drafts will be designed as Working Draft <no>. See also section 4.1.

|Specification of the conceptual model
|The specification will provide the definition of the concepts and relationships and eventual synonyms

|e-Procurement Ontology
|OWL expression of the ontology. The OWL expression will be included as an annex in D01, but also published separately at a persistent URI under the Commission's URI Policy.
|===

=== Assumptions

The following assumptions have been taken into account:

* The e-procurement ontology takes into account the data standards and structures described in the document Data Structures and Standards used at the Publications Office, Version: 1.0.0 of 19 December 2016 so as to ensure seamless testing of the ontology in the environment of the Publications Office.
* The e-procurement ontology is expressed in OWL2 in conformance with the conditions listed in section 2.1 of the W3C Recommendation OWL 2 Web Ontology Language Conformance (Second Edition)
* The e-procurement ontology is made available on-line under the ISA Open Metadata Licence v1.111
* The Working Group consists of experts in the following areas:
** e-procurement, taking into consideration the perspective of the stakeholder they represent;
** data modelling and ontology design; and
** OWL and the wider area of Linked Open Data technologies.
* The members of the Working Group share an objective of reaching consensus by finding common ground across potentially different perspectives.

=== Risks

A number of risks can be identified. Table 3 lists these risks with an indication of the impact, the likelihood and a proposed mitigation strategy.

== COST, TIMING AND RESOURCES

=== Cost

The project cost in financial terms is not estimated, however the human resources required is estimated.

Table 4 contains estimates of the time required for the different roles of the involved experts. These estimates are based on previous experiences with the development of other interoperability specification in the ISA/ISA2 programmes.

=== Timing and Milestones
The overall time plan for the work is shown in Table 5. The table includes the calendar months that would result from a possible start of the project right after the summer holiday of 2017.

|===

Given this overall time plan, a meeting plan for the Working Group and delivery of intermediate draft could look as shown in Table 6. The actual plan should be decided in the first meeting of the Working Group in Month 0. Depending on the size of the working group, the number of entities in the ontology and the occurrence of contentious issues,
the plan may be revised to include more or fewer meetings and drafts, as time passes.

The mention of "meetings" in Table 6 does not imply that face-to-face meeting must be held in all cases. For most meetings, teleconference facilities will be sufficient. However, it is advisable to plan for some face-to-face meetings at crucial points in time, for example at the start of the work (E1/M1) and before issuing the draft for public review (E16/M2).

Table 6 includes the proposed activities to be carried out by the Working Group. The work preparing the items listed with the meetings two, three and four will be undertaken by the Editors between meetings.

In Table 6, one of the activities for the first meeting is to set priorities for the use cases that were decided in the inception phase. A list of the use cases is included in Annex I.
For each of those use cases, the Editor will further develop the use case according to the methodology presented in the inception phase. In the meetings two to six, the use cases will be presented by the Editor, and the working group will come to a consensus to any changes that need to be made to the use case.

For the development of the conceptual data model Editors will derive the concepts from the use cases as described in D02.01: “Specification of the process and methodology to develop the eProcurement ontology with initial draft of the eProcurement Ontology for 3 use case”. The Editor will document this alongside the use cases and the concepts roughly one month ahead of each working group meeting. The documentation will also include the definition of concepts, identification of subclasses or subtypes, relevant properties and relationships.

The working group will review the documentation mentioned above ahead of the meetings. Working Group members may at any time propose additional concepts to be added to the conceptual model. Such proposals will be discussed by the Working Group; the proposed concept will be added if the Working Group decides that the proposed concept is relevant and necessary.

== APPROACH

The project will be based on the ISA Process and Methodology for the development of semantic agreements12 as described in section 2 of the Report on policy support for e-procurement.

=== Process
An important part of the process as described in the ISA Process and Methodology for the development of semantic agreements, and in particular the establishment of the Working Group, has already taken place in the preparatory phase. Therefore, the process to be followed by the Working Group in this Project consists of the following six elements:

.: Process overview
[cols="1"]
|===
|*Process*
_Reaching consensus_
|. Publish Working Drafts (Chair(s) and Editor(s))
. Review Working Drafts (Working Group)
. Publish last call Working Draft (Chair(s) and Editor(s))
. Review last call Working Draft (the Public)
. Gather evidence of acceptance (Chair(s) and Editor(s))
. Submit for endorsement (The Publications Office)
|===

=== Methodology
The methodology takes into account the step-by-step approach agreed in the preliminary phase. Building on the initial draft published at the end of the preliminary phase, the methodology involves the following five steps:

.: Methodology overview
[cols="1"]
|===
|*Methodology*
_Developing the ontology_
|Follow the step-by-step development process from requirements to OWL ontology (Editor(s), Working Group) which involves:
Step 1. Define use cases
Step 2. Define requirements from the use cases
Step 3. Develop a conceptual data model
Step 4. Consider reusing existing ontologies
Step 5. Define and implement an OWL ontology
|===

Drafts of the specification are published on Joinup; working group members provide comments on GitHub, referencing the relevant section in the document.

=== Change Management
The change management of the e-procurement ontology is defined on the basis of the approach described in the document “Description of a change management release and publication process for structural metadata specifications developed by the ISA Programme”.

The main characteristics are:

* Openness: In order for public administrations to rely on specifications, the openness of the change management is a key – openness is also a key assessment criterion in the Common Assessment Method of Standards and Specifications
(CAMSS)14. Openness means that requests for changes can be submitted by any stakeholder and that the analysis and decisions taken are logged in a transparent manner. An open change management process improves the quality of the
specification.
* Controlled change: Public administrations that use structural metadata or implement specifications must not be negatively impacted by unexpected changes to these specifications. A release schedule must be established, allowing changes to take place in a stepwise and traceable manner. New releases should also be versioned consistently.
The approach includes work flows for several types of changes: editorial changes, minor semantic changes and major semantic changes.

As part of the approach, a version numbering scheme and time table is defined:

* Editorial changes and bug fixes
Once per year, the submitted requests for this type of change are collected and
processed.
The resulting release is numbered X.Y.(Z+1), e.g. 1.0.1, 1.0.2 etc.

* Minor semantic changes
Once per year, the submitted requests for this type of change are collected and
processed. At this time, also editorial changes and bug fixes are processed.
The resulting release is numbered X.(Y+1).0, e.g. 1.1.0, 1.2.0 etc.

* Major semantic changes
Every second year, the submitted requests for this type of change are collected and
processed. At that time, also editorial changes and bug fixes as well as minor
semantic changes are processed.
The resulting release is numbered (X+1).0.0, e.g. 2.0.0, 3.0.0 etc.

* Businesses need to participate in procurement,
https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/issues/15
* Buyers need to buy things, which means following the e-procurement phases,
https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/issues/15. This
use case includes (and therefore could be breakdown into other use cases at a lower granular level):
** Creating new information (e.g. description of the procurement, giving points for award criteria).
** Reusing information from different databases and domains, such as
* business registries (to reduce administrative burden and ensure consistency of information); and
* tax, social payments, etc. systems (to verify that potential contractors meet selection criteria).
** (Sending information to other systems to ensure transparency etc. requirements are met, e.g. contract registers).
* Other public entities are directly involved in the e-procurement phases,
https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/issues/15. This use case includes (and therefore could be breakdown into other use cases at a lower granular level):
** Creating new information (e.g. review authority freezing the procurement process, rejecting a complaint, or awarding damages).
** Exchanging data between e-procurement systems and systems used by auditors and review bodies, so that it is easier for them to check the validity of the procurement process.
** Regulators (ministries, review bodies, etc.), citizens, journalists, NGOs, academics, buyers, etc. use the data to answer policy-relevant questions,
https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/issues/15. This use case includes (and therefore could be breakdown into other use cases at a lower granular level):
** Accessing information created by the use cases above.
** Accessing information created specifically to be used only in this use case.
** Connecting this information with other information, in particular:
* budget systems (to answer questions linked to following the money).
(Note: e-invoicing is not included in this section, because it falls within the scope of "e-procurement phases described in the Project Charter", i.e. the first use cases in this list.); and
* contract registers (to allow answering more sophisticated questions, e.g. linked to the full text of contracts).
* Analyse the success rate of the procurement process and the reasons for failure,
as well as estimate the costs associated,
https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/issues/16
* Long term analysis about the evolution of procurement activities in the EU Institutions,
https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/issues/16
* Providing information for Contract Registries,
https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/issues/18
* Enable the publication of notices as linked open data to enable the exploitation of the corresponding data through the semantic web in ways yet to be envisaged,
https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/issues/18
