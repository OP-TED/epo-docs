* Two ePO modules define the concepts for the ESPD:
** xref:guides/moduleGuide.adoc#acc[eAccess], covering the ESPD Request.
** xref:guides/moduleGuide.adoc#sub[eSubmission], covering the ESPD Response.

* These concepts can be used by developers working on the https://github.com/OP-TED/ESPD-EDM[ESPD Exchange Data Model (EDM)] in order to develop an ESPD service.

* The documentation around the ESPD can be found https://docs.ted.europa.eu/ESPD-EDM/latest/index.html[here].
