= Methodology

The workflow documentation was approached as an Enterprise Architecture (EA) project, applying a structured framework to capture and organise the workflow for managing the eProcurement Ontology (ePO) lifecycle. The ArchiMate modeling language was used to visually represent the various stages, dependencies, and artefacts within a simplified, layered architecture. This approach allows for clear documentation of roles, processes, and artefacts across the Business, Application, and Technology layers. +
The document follows a structured EA view, using ArchiMate to provide a consistent template across layers. Key goals include:

* Capturing business processes and stakeholder responsibilities.
* Defining artefact versioning within GitHub and across repositories.
* Providing clarity on required artefacts, their purposes, and generation methods.
* Applying simplified views of Business, Application, and Technology layers, with realised connections and support dependencies across layers.
This document does not include technical specifications of supporting tools, such as Model2Owl, Enterprise Architect UML Editor, GitHub Actions, Git clients, etc., or descriptions of procurement data models. Instead, the document focuses on the procedural framework, artefact requirements, and lifecycle stages suitable for ePO specific case, leaving the internal workings of associated technologies beyond its scope.
