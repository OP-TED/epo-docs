The purpose of using **GitHub** is to control the progress of the project. This includes the following sections:
* **Code**: this section includes the folder structure that will contain all documentation (internal and deliverables) of the project. For further information see: [Code](https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology) 
* **Issues**: in this section, the team makes a note of the matters that have arisen during the working day. This also allows to discuss the specific issue with the other team members through comments. For further information see: [Issues](https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/issues) 
* **Project**: After each working day, we write down the action points to do for each member of the group. These action points are classified by the following labels: to do, in progress, done.  For more information visit: [Projects](https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/projects) 
* **Wiki**: contains project management information such as: the methodology, the tools, the conceptual model, the project log book, the results and the decisions. For further information of each section see: [Wiki](https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/wiki)

#### **Enterprise Architect** 

Enterprise Architect is used to model the Conceptual Data Model. The purpose of this tool is to obtain a graphic representation of the Business Terms (BT), including their properties, and all their relations established in the DED. The following picture represents...

#### **Vocbench** and **Protégé** 

These two tools are used to implement and manage the ontology. As the analysis phase progresses together with the conceptual model, the ontology will be implemented in Protégé and Vocbench.

#### **Zotero**

In order to collect references and cite them in the ePO documentation the OP has created a Zotero Group named [e-Procurement Ontology](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2096233/e-procurement_ontology?). 

Zotero is a free software that helps you collect, cite, and share research. You have to register as a Zotero user. Once registered you will able to access the e-Procurement Ontology references.

All members of the Working Group are welcome to contribute to the enrichment of this bibliographic reference collection. To contribute click on the Zotero link, in the Wiki page. To be able to contribute you need to:

1. Register as a Zotero user
2. Sign in in the Zotero website
3. Once redirected to the ePO group push the button "Join" to join the group.

We recommend you to:

1. Download the freeware stand-alone software application (download normally available from the [Zotero home page](https://www.zotero.org/); 

2. Install the Zotero Connector as an extension of your preferred browser (see also the Zotero plugins for additional features).
