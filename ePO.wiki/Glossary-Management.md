The ePO Glossary is fundamental for the Ontology to represent the exact knowledge about the eProcurement as understood and used in Europe.

Hence the contribution of the experts in the e-Procurement business domain is crucial. Anyone interested in contributing to the improvement of the ePO Glossary is welcome to propose new concepts and definitions or to suggest modifications to the existing ones.

## How to contribute

If you want to contribute to the improvement or extension of the ePO Glossary:

If you are not yet a member of the Working Group, you must first register as such. Contact an [EPO Administrator](mailto:op-eprocurement-ontology@publications.europa.eu) to register;

## How to improve a concept

1. Open the [Glossary](https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/wiki/eProcurement-Glossary) in a new window;
2. Search for the concept you want to improve in the Glossary; e.g. "Abnormally low tenders"
3. Copy the text of the entry ("Abnormally low tenders"). Now you have it in the clipboard;
4. Go the GitHub [Issues](https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/issues) and create a new Issue;
5. In the title of the new Issue introduce **GLOSSARY-**; and
6. Paste the concept you copied in the clipboard; e.g. "Abnormally low tenders"; and
7. Optionally, add a very short text related to the issue, e.g. **: definition improvement**;
8. Provide a sufficient description of what the issue is in the current definition and how you propose to improve it, and examples;
9. Provide your own definition or term representing the concept (if that is the issue);
10. Assign the label "Glossary" to the Issue (see example below);
11. Submit the issue.

_Example_: 

![Glossary Issue](https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology.github.io/blob/master/images/GlossaryIssueMaintenance.png)

## How to add a new glossary entry

1. Go the GitHub [Issues](https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/issues) space and create a new Issue;
2. In the title of the new Issue introduce **GLOSSARY-**; 
3. Introduce a text representing the concept; e.g. **Economic Operator**; 
4. Add the text **: New concept**; 
5. Provide the definition of the new new concept; 
6. Assign the label "Glossary";
7. Submit the issue.

_Example_:

## How to search for issues related to the Glossary

_You can either_:

Option 1. Search for issues labelled with "glossary"

* Click on "Labels":

![Searching labels](https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology.github.io/blob/master/images/GlossarySearchingByLabel_1.png)

* And click on "glossary", this will return the list of issues related to the glossary:

![List of labels](https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology.github.io/blob/master/images/ListOfLabels.png)

Option 2. You can also search for issues containing the word "GLOSSARY", optionally followed by the text representing the concept. This will filter the list of issues with the text introduced in the search field:

![Filtered search](https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology.github.io/blob/master/images/IssueSearchByFilteredNamed.png)

## Discussions and decisions about the Glossary

Issues requesting changes about the entries of the glossary or asking for the creation of new entries are intended to start collaborative discussions that shall end in a final decision agreed by the majority of the members of the Working Group. 

To discuss about definition changes or new entries requests search for the issue and add your own comment. At some point, the Working Group will agree on the issue and will close it: 


![Glossary discussion thread](https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology.github.io/blob/master/images/GlossaryDiscussionThread.png)

## Maintenance of the ePO Glossary final version

The final decisions will be gathered in the [ePO Glossary spread-sheet](https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/blob/master/v2.0.0/02_IR_DED/eProcurement_glossary.xlsx) (tab _"ePO Dictionary"_ of the spread-sheet).

The ePO team in charge of the development and maintenance of the Ontology, and only them, will regularly peruse all the closed issues and will ensure that the entries in the ePO Glossary spread-sheet are correct and up to the date.
