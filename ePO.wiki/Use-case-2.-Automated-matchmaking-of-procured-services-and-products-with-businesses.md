|Title|Automated matchmaking of procured services and products with businesses.|
|Category|Innovation & value added services|
|Description|In the first phase of the e-procurement process, e-Notification, a system provided by contracting authorities or an independent private provider checks the procurement criteria across the capabilities of economic operators. In the case an economic operator fulfils the criteria, the system automatically informs them about the new opportunity. In the case of the criteria is partially fulfilled, the system provides information about complementary economic operators with whom they can cooperate to answer the call for tender. For economic operators, it represents a gain of time to identify relevant call for tenders and potential partners as well as an improved quality thanks to optimised partnerships; whereas, contracting authorities take advantage of increased market competition and of improved quality of tenderers.|
|Actors|Automated system|
|Final recipients|Contracting authorities, Economic operators|
|Preconditions|A system or repository which contains capabilities of economic operators and calls for tender with their procurement criteria published by contracting authorities.|
|Flow| <ol><li>As part of a regular process, a system finds a call for paperclips. It then maps the capabilities of economic operators available in their own repository, which is aggregating data from European business registries to check if there exist companies that produce the required type of paperclips according to the procurement criteria.</li><li>From this mapping, the system identifies a partial match with the company BudgetClip and sends a message to Bob, the bid manager at BudgetClip to make him aware of the opportunity and propose him to cooperate with another company, CustomSteel, in order to be able to fulfil all the requirements defined in the selection criteria.</li><li>In partnership with CustomSteel, Bob prepares the tender and sends it to the contracting authority, awaiting a positive outcome and looking forward to reading his company’s name in the contract award notice.</li></ol>|
