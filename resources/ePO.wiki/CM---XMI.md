### Conceptual data model diagram - [XMI format](https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/blob/master/v2.0.0/03_Analysis%20and%20design/EA-Conceptual%20Model/XMI/ePO-CM_v2.0.0.xml): 

The [Conceptual Data Model diagram](https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/wiki/Conceptual-Model) was originally produced using the Enterprise Architect tool (you can download the *.eap file from the Github source repository, [here](https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/blob/master/v2.0.0/03_Analysis%20and%20design/EA-Conceptual%20Model/ePO-CM_v2.0.0.eap). 

For **those who do not use Enterprise Architect but use Open Source or Freeware tools** that can work with usual standards, we have exported the Conceptual Data Model diagram as an XMI v2.1. XMI stands for XML METADATA INTERCHANGE, and it is a widely used XML defining the following aspects involved in describing objects in XML:

* The representation of objects in terms of XML elements and attributes;
* The standard mechanisms to link objects within the same file or across files;
* The validation of XMI documents using XML Schemas;
* Object identity, which allows objects to be referenced from other objects in terms of IDs and UUIDs.
