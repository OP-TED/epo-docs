In order to collect references and cite them in the ePO documentation the OP has created a Zotero Group named link:https://www.zotero.org/groups/2096233/e-procurement_ontology?[e-Procurement Ontology]. 

Zotero is a free software that helps you collect, cite, and share research. You have to register as a Zotero user. Once registered you will able to access the e-Procurement Ontology references.

2. Install the Zotero Connector as an extension of your preferred browser (see also the Zotero plugins for additional features).
