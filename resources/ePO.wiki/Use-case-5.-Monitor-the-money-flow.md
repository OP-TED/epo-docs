|Title|Monitor the money flow|
|Category|Transparency and monitoring|
|Description|In order to obtain an exhaustive and unified view of the flow of public money, from tax collection and budget over to procurement until spending, e-Procurement data should be integrated with other datasets such as budget, spending and location data. A common ontology such as the ePO is necessary in order to interlink such datasets, and help with the creation of a unified view over the flow of public money.|

|Preconditions||
|Flow| A procurement watchdog is analysing the flow of public money during an interval of two years. Using the ePO as the common model for representing data, allows the watchdog to find their way through the different sources that have to be consulted, e.g. budget dataset, calls for tender and procurement notices, and to interlink the data in order to identify the trails. Examples of the data to be interlinked by the watchdog, in order to discover the flow of money could be:the value of the contract;the name of the awarded tender;the location of the awarded tender; and the department of the public administration that awarded the tender. Information requirements: In this case it would be required: Of the ePO to model all procurement process data e.g. calls for tenders, notices etc.; Of the ePO to model economic operator data e.g. name, location etc.; Of the ePO to model contract data e.g. contract value; Of the ePO to model exclusion criteria etc.; Of the ePO to link to other datasets e.g. budget datasets, spending datasets, tax information datasets.Clara publishes the newspaper article highlighting her findings and explaining how she reached those conclusions by cross-referencing data from TED.Thanks to the article, citizens become aware of the spending on tram maintenance between countries.|
