== Introduction

Given the increasing importance of data standards for e-Procurement, a number of initiatives driven by the public sector, the industry and academia have been kick started in the recent years. Some have grown organically, while others are the result of standardisation work. The vocabularies and the semantics that they are introducing, the phases of public procurement that they are covering, and the technologies that they are using all differ. These differences hamper data interoperability and thus its reuse by them or by the wider public. 

This creates the need for a common data standard for publishing procurement data, hence allowing data from different sources to be easily accessed and linked, and consequently reused. 
In 2016 the link:++https://publications.europa.eu/en/home++[Publications Office of the European Union] (Publications Office or OP) was commissioned by the link:++https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/home_en++[ISA Programme] 
to organise and support the development of such a standard. This document describes the efforts made by the European Commission to develop the developemtn of an "*eProcurement Ontology*" (henceforth referred to as the ePO). 

=== About ePO v1.00

One fundamental document for the development of the eOP is its link:++https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/document/2017-08/d02.02_project_charter_proposal_v1.00_0.pdf++[Project Charter]. This document defines the principles, scope and the foreseen time-line and resources needed to develop the Ontology. 

In this document the ultimate objective was stated as "_to put forth a commonly agreed OWL Ontology that will conceptualise, formally encode and make available in an open, structured and machine-readable format data about public procurement, covering it from end to end, i.e. from notification, through tendering to awarding, ordering, invoicing and payment_". 

The figure below represents the eProcurement Value-Chain as commonly envisaged in Europe (source: OP).

An the scope was set to the "_specification showing the conceptual model and its representation in OWL, and the deployment of the ontology and related code lists and classifications on the link:++http://publications.europa.eu/mdr/++[Metadata Registry]"._

The aim was to produce the final Ontology within twelve months including a public review of at least two months; and a set of three deliverables was identified as the main outcome of the project:

For the development of these objectives the OP team proposed a methodological approach based on the recommendations and good practices footnoteref:[note1, Cfr. link:http://protege.stanford.edu/publications/ontology_development/ontology101.pdf["Ontology Development 101: A Guide to
Creating Your First Ontology"], by Natalya F. Noy and Deborah L.

=== ePO v.20.0. objectives and scope

The main objective of the ePO v2.0.0 is to *take leverage of the results produced in version 1.00* and to *extend and hone the OWL Ontology*. To reach these objectives the owners of the project have set the following strategic objectives:

. Focus on only one important policy area. We propose focusing on "*Transparency*";

. Extend and hone a small set of phases of the eProcurement, if possible only one. Our proposal is *e-Notification* and *e-Access*. This does not preclude the Working Group or any other stakeholder to use the Ontology to implement the other Use Cases defined in v1.00, or the opposite, to use the Use Cases to test phase(s) developed so far;

. Develop and test exhaustively the phase chosen before undertaking the evolution and perfectioning of other phases;

. While developing the selected phase, elicit and define information requirements and data elements that will be used in other phases, even if the selected phases - i.e. e-Notification and e-Access-do not use them;

The above statements imply that *the scope of this ePO v2.0.0 is set to the e-Notification and e-Access phases* of the Public e-Procurement value-chain, represented as blue-coloured in the figure below:

=== Methodological approach

TODO: ADD REFERENCES TO DIRECTIVES, SDOs, etc. [TODO:]

To reach the strategic objectives stated above this version 2.0.0 of the ePO proposes to evolve the previous v1.00 based on a few global principles:

. *Business and Information requirements cannot contradict the EU and the Member States legislations*;

** The ePO Ontology is soundly based on the EU Directives on Public Procurement, the new e-Forms Regulation (under consultation), the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and other EU legal frameworks related to the Public Procurement.

. *Information Requirements should be identified through the exhaustive analysis of the business processes*;

** This version 2.0.0 takes as inputs works like the CEN/BII Workshops, the e-Sens developments on the VCD and the ESPD, the DG GROWTH's ESPD Service, e-Certis and ESPD-Exchange Data Model, as well as international standards like UN/CEFACT and OASIS UBL. All of them that used an UN/CEFACT Universal Method Modelling (UMM) approach that represent the "value-chain Use Cases" to identify the information requirements exhaustively. The "value-chain Use Cases" e-Notification and e-Access are perfectly described in these works and cast an extremely exhaustive list of information requirements and business rules. 

. *Use Cases around the policy area should be defined to (i) complement the identification of information requirements; and (ii) test the completeness, correctness and performance of the Ontology*;

** The "Use Cases" defined in the ePO v1.00 are essential instruments to complete and test the information requirements elicited during the analysis of the business processes. In this version we propose to focus on the "Use Case 1: Data Journalism" as the e-Notification and e-Access provide the largest part of the requirements necessary to implement the case.

. *The Ontology must always be tested and perfected using a sufficiently large sample of real data*;

** The analysis and design of an Ontology cannot be declared as finished unless it is tested. The Use Cases are only one of the essential elements to reach this goal. However the testing cannot be trusted unless the data used are not (i) abundant (maximum corpus of data), (ii) real data, and (iii) of the maximum possible quality. In the case of the *e-Notification* and *e-Access* phases this specification proposes the use of the Tender Electronic Daily (TED) platform to retrieve, transform and load the data contained in Prior Information Notices, Contract Notices, Contract Award Notices and Calls for Tenders into OWL graphs. This ePO 2.0.0 is accompanied by a Proof-Of-Concept development oriented precisely to test the Ontology.

The Knowledge Map (K-Map) footnoteref:[note3, See link:http://lice.licef.ca/index.php/gmot-motplus-et-mot/["MOTPlus, Modélisation par Object Typés", by LICEF, Téluq]] method and tools below provides an abstract representation of the scope for the ePO v2.0.0.

=== ePO governance

In order to develop these global deliverables the following Governance Structure, the following roles and responsibilities were established in ePO v1.00 and are still valid for the governance of the ePO v2.0.0:

With the following *roles and responsibilites*:
